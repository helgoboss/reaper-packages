            <changelog><![CDATA[- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. Itâ€™s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they donâ€™t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)

            <changelog><![CDATA[- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track
