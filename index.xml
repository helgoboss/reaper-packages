                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" in a better way (translating negative values to zero instead of ignoring them)
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed UI inconsistency by hiding track anchor dropdown if not relevant

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" in a better way (translating negative values to zero instead of ignoring them)
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed UI inconsistency by hiding track anchor dropdown if not relevant

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action

            <version name="1.10.0" author="helgoboss" time="2020-08-27T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

            <version name="1.10.0-pre8" author="helgoboss" time="2020-08-19T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track
