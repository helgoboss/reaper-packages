- Playtime: #1348 Added new action and toolbar button Show/hide custom Playtime to use customized Playtime instance from track template (see tutorial)
- Playtime: #1339 Added matrix recording option Allow tempo detection recording which lets you opt out from automatic tempo detection recording in stopped state when the metronome is disabled, instead always doing a count-in recording (with an audible click, no matter what)

- Playtime: #1351 Improved visibility of playing clips on Launchpads
- Playtime: #1322 Improved Luau matrix building by allowing any field of the top-level table to be empty (using defaults)
- Playtime: #1300 Fixed undo closing MIDI editor and sometimes even track after inserting first note
- Playtime: #1354 Fixed grid controller scrolling possibly getting stuck after changing matrix size
- Playtime: #1090 Fixed grid controller right and down scrolling LEDs lighting up although not scrollable

                <changelog><![CDATA[- ReaLearn: #1287 Added 3 factory controller presets for Softube Console 1 mk2
- ReaLearn: #800 Added possibility to produce relative values in EEL control transformations
- ReaLearn: #1294 Added control transformation variable 'realearn\_last\_feedback\_value' (might be useful in mappings with virtual target, rarely needed, considered experimental, used in the new Console 1 MIDI relative preset)
- ReaLearn: #1290 Added possibility to pick among the actually available virtual control elements in the main mapping source section
- ReaLearn: #715 Added control transformation variable 'realearn\_timestamp', which is based on audio blocks and for MIDI even takes intra-block offset into account (it can't get more precise)
- ReaLearn: #1295 Added function 'realearn\_dbg' to EEL transformation (a debugging tool that prints floating-point values to stdout)
- ReaLearn: #1293 Improved preset picker by categorizing by device manufacturer
- ReaLearn: #1289 Improve feedback send behavior "Prevent echo feedback" by also making it work when used in a controller mapping (actually the most important place for using this option ... previously, it only worked when used in a main mapping)
- ReaLearn: Improve glue documentation by adding signal flow diagrams
- ReaLearn: Improved usability by clearing search field and filters when switching between compartments (this was confusing)
- ReaLearn: #1288 Fixed text entry in control transformation editor if a key is defined as global REAPER hotkey (most importantly, the SPACE key)
- ReaLearn: Fixed error when removing mapping while some mapping panel's edit control had focus

                <changelog><![CDATA[- ReaLearn: #1124 Added possibility to do global MIDI transformation: See new options in target "MIDI: Send message" (yes!)
- ReaLearn: #1158 Added possibility to use keyboard input in addition to MIDI/OSC input (yes!)
- ReaLearn: #1155 Added menu entry "User interface => Background colors" to globally disable the use of background colors (useful when using custom Windows themes)
- ReaLearn: #1157 Improved control via keyboard by not processing keyboard input when user is entering text (needs REAPER 7.23+)
- ReaLearn: #1170 Fixed REAPER actions "ReaLearn: Find first mapping by source" (wouldn't find certain mappings) and "ReaLearn: Learn single mapping (reassigning source)" (always created new mappings)
- ReaLearn: #1152 Fixed occasional "FX not loadable" error (e.g. when removing FX)
- ReaLearn: #1162 Fixed timing information not being passed on when translating device MIDI to device MIDI via target "MIDI: Send message"
- ReaLearn: #1126 Fixed error "impossible" when on monitoring FX and pressing target menu button
- Playtime: #1131 Added the possibility to record clips from stopped state with a count-in/pre-roll (simply turn metronome on and record, right-click metronome to set length of pre-roll ... makes users who come from other session views feel more at home)
- Playtime: #1163 Added track PDC information, including help texts (as a warning not to expect miracles when using high-latency FX)
- Playtime: #1168 Added support for REAPER's "Smooth seek": Clips will keep playing as if nothing happened. Current limitation: Smooth-seek to the left still leads to retriggering when using PDC.
- Playtime: #1119 Improved usability by always playing ignited clips when starting one specific clip when playback is stopped (makes users who come from other session views feel more at home)
- Playtime: #1146 Improved section and fade behavior and defaults in order to prevent unwanted auto-fades
- Playtime: #1132 Improved usability by making the static section an expert option and renaming it to "Source cut"
- Playtime: #1166 Improved usability by replacing the "Silence mode" design with a more traditional "Stopped" design (also, Playtime now starts by default in stopped state)
- Playtime: #1136 Improved keyboard control by handling SPACE even if set as a global shortcut in REAPER (needs REAPER 7.23+)
- Playtime: #1137 Improved usability by letting SPACE keep ongoing recordings instead of discarding them
- Playtime: #1164 Fixed clips completely losing sync when enabling or disabling high-latency FX due to PDC (for now only fixed when REAPER transport is stopped)
- Playtime: #1179 Fixed audio clips playing back slightly delayed right after recording (bug was introduced in 2.16.2)
- Playtime: #1143 Fixed Launchpad Pro detection on Windows if device name has a prefix (e.g. '2- ')
- Playtime: #1165 Fixed inability to use MIDI input devices with IDs > 63
- Playtime: #1149 Fixed App not getting keyboard focus unless clicking on specific areas such as the matrix view (keyboard shortcuts now work immediately after opening the app)
- Playtime: #1160 Fixed play cursors in MIDI editor and waveform view noticeably off when using high-latency FX (due to PDC)
- Playtime: #1156 Fixed audio clips turning silent when starting REAPER playback and having high-latency FX in the signal flow (due to PDC)
- Playtime: #1135 Fixed tempo detection recordings not working via controller
- Playtime: #1134 Fixed immediate playback of clip in stopped state not working via controller

- ReaLearn: #252 Added menu action to make targets non-sticky in many different ways
- ReaLearn: #1093 Added X-Touch One preset
- ReaLearn: #1097 Added possibility to disable learning for particular virtual sources (useful e.g. in order to enforce learning of fader movements instead of fader touch events)
- ReaLearn: #1097 Improved usability by ignoring fader touch events of all presets based on Mackie Control Universal when learning sources in the main compartment (you can finally learn fader movements without having to press the fader before pressing the "Learn source" button)
- ReaLearn: #1093 Improved usability by turning various presets into built-in factory presets (e.g. Mackie Control Universal and DAW control)
- ReaLearn: #1095 Improved projection edit mode by showing virtual control element names if mapping names are empty

            <version name="2.16.0" author="helgoboss" time="2024-07-07T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- General: Important rebranding: The plug-in has been renamed from "ReaLearn" to "Helgobox - ReaLearn & Playtime". Helgobox unites 2 products: ReaLearn (free and open-source) and Playtime (paid and mostly closed-source).
- General: The plug-in now requires at least REAPER 6.11 (I simplified some code by using REAPER 6.11 features)
- General: Changed scripting language from Lua 5.4 to Luau (existing scripts should run in the same way as before because all Lua 5.4 functions that I have previously unlocked for usage are also available in Luau)
- General: Internal change: Renamed lots of Prometheus metrics
- General: Internal change: Enforced UTF-8-encoded paths very early in the processing when interfacing with the REAPER API (REAPER by contract should provide UTF-8 encoded paths, if not it's a bug in REAPER)
- General: Internal change: Use Rust 1.79.0
- General: Added welcome screen which allows one to add a Playtime toolbar button. That works best with current REAPER releases, older REAPER versions require a restart.
- General: Added Helgobox App: An app that provides the user interface for Playtime and ReaLearn Projection. Right now, it is only available embedded into REAPER and only on macOS on Windows. In the future, it will be made available for Linux, Android and iOS, eventually replacing the ReaLearn Companion App.
- General: #906 Added a REAPER extension, which is automatically loaded at REAPER startup and acts as a supplement to the actual VST plug-in. Provides a convenient entry 'Helgobox' in the REAPER 'Extensions' menu and other features right after REAPER start, which would otherwise only be available if at least one ReaLearn VST plug-in instance is loaded. This extension is currently shipped on Windows and macOS. It's optional, ReaLearn will also work without it!
- General: #908 Added extensive auto-generated Luau type definitions for building ReaLearn presets, ReaLearn MIDI script sources and Playtime matrices with auto-completion and error reporting (for code editors with Luau support, e.g. Visual Studio Code)
- General: Internal change: Added counter of undesired real-time allocations to UI (debug builds only)
- General: Improved import by warning when invalid top-level properties were detected (which could indicate wrong usage of the import API)
- General: Improved error reporting when importing invalid Luau code by making the error cause more visible
- General: Improved reliability of preset loading/import in high-CPU usage situations by increasing the maximum execution time of Luau scripts
- General: Improved reporting of general errors by not just logging repeated error messages as vertical dashes (this was confusing)
- General: Improved Lua-based presets and imports by detecting cyclic module dependencies
- General: #913 Improved general performance by introducing lots of small-scale boosts after profiling hot code (non-crypto hash functions, unnecessary allocation and processing)
- General: #915 Improved robustness and usability by not participating in REAPER's undo anymore (this can prevent potentially fatal but in any case surprising scenarios in which doing an undo in REAPER sets back ReaLearn and Playtime to a very old state, requires REAPER >= v7.09+dev0202)
- General: Improved resource usage (by firing up threads for async logging and metrics only if enabled, by letting ReaLearn and Clip Engine metrics share the same thread, by  making app and server share the same one-threaded async runtime and by stopping async deallocation thread and async runtime when last ReaLearn instance gone)
- General: Improved plug-in scanning speed (Helgobox won't initialize a few things if it knows it's just being scanned anyway)
- General: Improved resource clean-up on Windows when REAPER preference "Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins" enabled
- General: Fixed some incorrect detection of recursive tables in Luau code on import
- General: #875 Fixed deadlock when using 500+ Helgobox instances
- General: Fixed potential hard crash in process\_f64 call
- General: Fixed possible panic when closing REAPER
- General: #916 Fixed scaling issue on Linux (colors are now also available on Linux but still looks a bit funny, hopefully the dark mode detection for SWELL customizations works now)
- General: Internal change: Removed old logging framework
- ReaLearn: Added generic main preset for changing FX parameters
- ReaLearn: #870 Added ability to add additional units to one ReaLearn instance (= one ReaLearn instance can now deal with multiple controllers)
- ReaLearn: #901 Added support for compartment presets written in the Luau language (including the ability to require other Luau modules in the same namespace)
- ReaLearn: #908 Added menu option to create a ready-made preset development workspace that can be opened in Visual Studio Code (see workspace README for details)
- ReaLearn: Added possibility to reuse Luau code defined once within a compartment preset across all MIDI script sources used in that compartment (avoids having to duplicate device-specific code in hundreds of mapping, saving memory ... and it just makes sense)
- ReaLearn: #902 Added support for factory presets (they are really built-in, not shipped separately ... presets currently distributed via ReaPack will disappear soon)
- ReaLearn: #903 Added feedback logging to mapping panels (analogously to control logging)
- ReaLearn: #900 Added "Auto units" feature (1. Globally define what controllers you have => 2. Choose which main preset you want to use for which controller => 3. Make one or several ReaLearn instances automatically load/unload those presets whenever the controllers are connected/disconnected ... controller manager is a part of the Helgobox App, which is currently only available to Playtime Early Access testers)
- ReaLearn: #905 Added possibility to add metadata to Luau presets (displayed in the upcoming Helgobox App and used for the new "Auto units" feature as well as automatic creation of known controllers
- ReaLearn: #905 Added auto-magical creation of known MIDI controllers (via MIDI device inquiry, used for the new "Auto units" features)
- ReaLearn: #757 Added possibility to write feedback scripts in the glue section: Now you can build arbitrary feedback messages using Lua code (custom text formatting is just one of the many possibilities).
- ReaLearn: #716 Added experimental Novation SL MkIII Pot Browser Control preset (available here)
- ReaLearn: #716 Added text placeholders "target.available", "global.realearn\_time", "target.discrete\_value" and "target.discrete\_value\_count"
- ReaLearn: #743 Added text placeholders "target.fx\_parameter.macro.new\_section.name" and "target.fx\_parameter.macro.section.index" to target "FX parameter: Set value"
- ReaLearn: #743 Added many text placeholders to targets "Pot: Browse presets" and "Pot: Load preset" for obtaining preset metadata such as author and comment
- ReaLearn: Improved virtual control by considering two same-named virtual control elements with different character the same (this change has only been made to named control elements, not to numbered ones!)
- ReaLearn: #923 Improved auto-load by falling back to initially active preset when no FX focused
- ReaLearn: #928 Improved both "After timeout" fire modes by respecting button filter setting (this makes long-press-on-release-off scenarios achievable with just one mapping)
- ReaLearn: Improved Projection feature by building it into the Helgobox App (which is only accessible to early-access Playtime testers at the moment)
- ReaLearn: Improved Midi Fighter Twister controller presets: Now Lua-based, with ReaLearn color support and available in 2 different virtual control schemes (grid and numbered)
- ReaLearn: Improved ReaLearn REAPER actions by showing an error if instance needed to execute the action and improving macOS message panel font size
- ReaLearn: Improved Lua MIDI scripts by allowing them to access the common compartment Lua module even when just calculating the feedback address
- ReaLearn: #904 Improved target menu by distinguishing between different target sections
- ReaLearn: #902 Improved preset sharing by introducing the concept of preset namespaces (each sub folder of the main/controller preset folder is now a namespace, that means it's completely self-contained and can be easily shared, each namespace shows up in a different sub menu when browsing presets)
- ReaLearn: #788 Improved shutdown behavior by switching all device LEDs/screens off and tearing all motor faders down when quitting REAPER
- ReaLearn: #914 Improved input/output pickers by distinguishing between available and not available devices
- ReaLearn: #913 Improved OSC performance by processing more OSC messages per cycle
- ReaLearn: Improved dummy target by making it work just like most other targets (generating pseudo feedback, value changes observable in mapping panel etc.)
- ReaLearn: #916 Improved user interface by adding colors
- ReaLearn: #864 Improved feedback due to conditional activation/deactivation by emitting it in deterministic order (in mapping order)
- ReaLearn: #716 Improved feedback possibilities by processing text feedback expressions and scripts even if target doesn't support normal (numerical) feedback
- ReaLearn: Fixed memorization of last color in color picker
- ReaLearn: #862 Fixed source "MIDI script" feedback address not being respected (important e.g. for switching feedback off correctly)
- ReaLearn: #863 Fixed ambiguous "kind" properties in ReaLearn Script (Lua import/export)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Playtime-related changes (details available for early-access testers only)
- Improved virtual control by considering two same-named virtual control elements with different character the same (this change has only been made to named control elements, not to numbered ones!)
- Improved auto-load by falling back to initially active preset when no FX focused
- Improved both "After timeout" fire modes by respecting button filter setting (this makes long-press-on-release-off scenarios achievable with just one mapping)
- Improved "suitable main preset selection" algorithm when connecting known controllers
- Improved import by warning when invalid top-level properties were detected (which could indicate wrong usage of the import API)
- Improved error reporting when importing invalid Luau code by making the error cause more visible
- Improved reliability of preset loading/import in high-CPU usage situations by increasing the maximum execution time of Luau scripts
- Improved reporting of general errors by not just logging repeated error messages as vertical dashes (this was confusing)
- Fixed memorization of last color in color picker
- Fixed broken connection from ReaLearn Companion running on Android
- Fixed possible errors when connecting MIDI devices (related to the new controller auto detection)
- Fixed some incorrect detection of recursive tables in Luau code on import
- Removed CSI MST import
- Internal change: Removed undocumented ReaLearn script utility functions
- Internal change: Removed old logging framework
- Internal change: Renamed lots of Prometheus metrics
- Internal change: Enforced UTF-8-encoded paths very early in the processing when interfacing with the REAPER API (REAPER by contract should provide UTF-8 encoded paths, if not it's a bug in REAPER)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Playtime-related changes (details available for early-access testers only)
- Changed scripting language from Lua 5.4 to Luau (existing scripts should run in the same way as before because all Lua 5.4 functions that I have previously unlocked for usage are also available in Luau)
- First mention of the upcoming product name "Helgobox": The VST plug-in that we know as ReaLearn will soon be renamed to "Helgobox". ReaLearn will stay as the central part of Helgobox. The other parts will be "Playtime" and (in long-term future) "Sound Pot". In a nutshell: Helgobox = ReaLearn + Playtime + SoundPot = A collection of creative tools that turns REAPER into a powerful musical instrument ... you will see the big picture as soon as Playtime 2 is revealed.
- Added new REAPER extension called "Helgobox", which is automatically loaded at REAPER startup and acts as a supplement to the actual VST plug-in. Provides a convenient top-level menu and other features right after start, which would otherwise only be available if at least one ReaLearn VST plug-in instance is loaded. This extension is currently shipped on Windows and macOS but in general it's optional, ReaLearn will also work without it!
- Added ability to add additional units to one ReaLearn instance (= one ReaLearn instance can now deal with multiple controllers)
- Added support for compartment presets written in the Luau language (including the ability to require other Luau modules in the same namespace)
- Added extensive auto-generated Luau type definitions for building ReaLearn presets, ReaLearn MIDI script sources and Playtime matrices with auto-completion and error reporting (for code editors with Luau support, e.g. Visual Studio Code)
- Added menu option to create a ready-made preset development workspace that can be opened in Visual Studio Code (see workspace README for details)
- Added possibility to reuse Luau code defined once within a compartment preset across all MIDI script sources used in that compartment (avoids having to duplicate device-specific code in hundreds of mapping, saving memory ... and it just makes sense)
- Added support for factory presets (they are really built-in, not shipped separately ... presets currently distributed via ReaPack will disappear soon)
- Added feedback logging to mapping panels (analogously to control logging)
- Added "Auto units" feature (1. Globally define what controllers you have => 2. Choose which main preset you want to use for which controller => 3. Make one or several ReaLearn instances automatically load/unload those presets whenever the controllers are connected/disconnected ... controller manager is a part of the Helgobox App, which is currently only available to Playtime Early Access testers)
- Added possibility to add metadata to Luau presets (displayed in the upcoming Helgobox App and used for the new "Auto units" feature as well as automatic creation of known controllers
- Added auto-magical creation of known MIDI controllers (via MIDI device inquiry, used for the new "Auto units" features)
- Improved target menu by distinguishing between different target sections
- Improved preset sharing by introducing the concept of preset namespaces (each sub folder of the main/controller preset folder is now a namespace, that means it's completely self-contained and can be easily shared, each namespace shows up in a different sub menu when browsing presets)
- Improved shutdown behavior by switching all device LEDs/screens off and tearing all motor faders down when quitting REAPER
- Improved input/output pickers by distinguishing between available and not available devices
- Improved OSC performance by processing more OSC messages per cycle
- Improved general performance by introducing lots of small-scale boosts after profiling hot code (non-crypto hash functions, unnecessary allocation and processing)
- Improved robustness and usability by not participating in REAPER's undo anymore (this can prevent potentially fatal but in any case surprising scenarios in which doing an undo in REAPER sets back ReaLearn and Playtime to a very old state, requires REAPER >= v7.09+dev0202)
- Improved dummy target by making it work just like most other targets (generating pseudo feedback, value changes observable in mapping panel etc.)
- Improved user interface by adding colors
- Fixed scaling issue on Linux (colors are now also available on Linux but still looks a bit funny, hopefully the dark mode detection for SWELL customizations works now)
- Internal change: Use Rust 1.75.0

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added possibility to write feedback scripts in the glue section: Now you can build arbitrary feedback messages using Lua code (custom text formatting is just one of the many possibilities).
- Added Novation SL MkIII Pot Browser Control preset (available here)
- Added text placeholders "target.available", "global.realearn\_time", "target.discrete\_value" and "target.discrete\_value\_count"
- Added text placeholders "target.fx\_parameter.macro.new\_section.name" and "target.fx\_parameter.macro.section.index" to target "FX parameter: Set value"
- Added many text placeholders to targets "Pot: Browse presets" and "Pot: Load preset" for obtaining preset metadata such as author and comment
- Pot Browser: Improved usability by stopping preview as soon as loading the preset
- Improved target "Pot: Preview preset" by using the same sound player as the Pot Browser (inherits its functionality such as customizable volume and stopping playback when preset loaded)
- Improved feedback due to conditional activation/deactivation by emitting it in deterministic order (in mapping order)
- Improved feedback possibilities by processing text feedback expressions and scripts even if target doesn't support normal (numerical) feedback
- Improved availability check for almost all Pot targets (good for advanced visual feedback of what Pot features are available in a certain situation, see new text placeholder "target.available")
- Fixed source "MIDI script" feedback address not being respected (important e.g. for switching feedback off correctly)
- Fixed ambiguous "kind" properties in ReaLearn Script (Lua import/export)
- Fixed "context.feedback\_value.color" not containing nil when no color set in source "MIDI script"
- Fixed possible freeze when using "Open in text editor on macOS" by completely disabling this function on macOS
- Fixed possible error when using "Selected" track selector and removing that selected track

- Pot Browser: Added new text feedback placeholders "fx\_parameter.macro.section.name" and "fx\_parameter.macro.name"
- Pot Browser: Added preset context menu action "Reveal preview in file manager"
- Pot Browser: Added preset metadata section containing information about author, vendor, file size and modification date (if available)
- Pot Browser: Added more options to configure when to display FX windows and when to hide them
- Pot Browser: Added preset context menu action "Pre-play" (This is fun! It's like a preview on steroids. Pot Browser will load the preview into RS5k sampler, making it playable on your keyboard. So you can play the sound in a lower quality without actually loading the preset. Useful if loading a preset is slow and you want to get a first impression before loading it. Or use it in creative ways!)
- Pot Browser: Improved UI a bit (show notifications a bit longer, better text formatting and error messages, better responsiveness, avoid empty "round dot" context menu)
- Pot Browser: Fixed VST2 plug-ins with negative magic number not showing up (e.g. "Op-X Pro II")
- Pot Browser: Fixed some Komplete banks and categories not showing up (e.g. "MiniMonsta 2"
- Pot Browser: Fixed NKS macro parameters for all VST3 plug-ins not being found
- Pot Browser: Fixed internal "FX presets" for all VST2 plug-ins not showing up
- Pot Browser: Fixed JSFX effects failing to load if they have a file extension (e.g. Saike's JSFX)
- Pot Browser: Fixed possible crash by preventing Pot Browser from replacing its associated ReaLearn instance

- Fixed issues with new REAPER v6.78+ dev builds (was totally broken)
- Fixed glue section user interface inconsistency
- Fixed possible errors with send targets when removing a hardware output send from a track

            <version name="2.14.0" author="helgoboss" time="2022-11-24T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new MIDI source "Specific program change" (which makes it more straightforward to react to specific programs)
- Added dynamic track expression variables "instance\_track\_tcp\_index" and "instance\_track\_mcp\_index"
- Added menu and help buttons to the header panel
- Added previous/next buttons to the mapping panel (for navigating in the list of mappings that's currently visible in the main panel)
- Added more comfortable editing for OSC feedback arguments and help button
- Added Lua snippet versioning (from now on, all Lua exports from ReaLearn will contain the ReaLearn version number; used for getting version conflict warnings on import and applying migration logic; in your own Lua code, you should make sure it's set from now on ... removing it will make ReaLearn think that it's an old preset and then it might apply some migration logic that you don't want)
- Added new takeover mode "Pickup (tolerant)" (prevents jumps but also makes extra sure the target doesn't get stuck, in addition to below mdmayfield improvements)
- Added new text feedback placeholder "target.width.mcu" to target "Track: Set stereo width" for pretty display of width value
- Added new experimental "Pot" targets for preset browsing in a large pot of presets (first supported preset database: Komplete NKS, see dedicated REAPER forum thread for details)
- Added new feedback-only source "Speech" for speaking out numeric or text feedback via Windows/macOS built-in text-to-speech engine (no Linux yet, sorry)
- Added new track selectors that respect track visibility in TCP or MCP
- Added new dynamic track variables "selected\_track\_tcp\_index" and "selected\_track\_mcp\_index"
- Added new options to target "Project: Navigate within tracks" to respect visibility in TCP or MCP
- Added fancy control transformation editor with visual preview of curve/transition (Windows/macOS only for now)
- Added control transformation template facility (including some first templates, hard-coded, Windows/macOS only for now)
- Added option to respect/ignore track grouping to supported track targets
- Added option to enable/disable selection ganging to supported track targets
- Added target control information to mapping panel (Very useful to understand what's going on! For real-time-MIDI-controlled mappings, this only works if target control logging is enabled.)
- Added new target "Global: Mouse" to control the mouse (one use case is to control the FX parameter which is currently under the mouse cursor)
- Added possibility to save compartment notes (they are also saved with compartment presets)
- Added multi-line editing and error reporting for EEL transformation formulas
- Added possibility to force or prevent smooth seek in seek and marker/region targets
- Added display type "Studiologic SL Keyboard display" for showing arbitrary text on the keyboard (tested with SL88)
- Added display types "X-Touch Mackie LCD" and "X-Touch Mackie LCD XT" for enabling LCD color support when certain X-Touch devices are in MCU mode
- Added various options to decide whether to keep ReaLearn active if its project tab is in the background (accessible via right-click menu)
- Added option to play sound when target has been invoked successfully ("Beep on success" checkbox at the bottom left of the mapping panel, great for trigger-like targets such as saving a snapshot)
- Added target "Track: Enable/disable parent send" (great for MIDI routing in the context of song switching)
- Added option to prevent resetting feedback when releasing sources (accessible via right-click menu, good for using REAPER/ReaLearn as a remote control for hardware devices)
- Added stop function to be used in control transformation formulas to emit a target value and stop the currently running transition at once
- Added context menu entry "Open preset folder"
- Added "Retrigger" option to target "FX parameter: Set value" (sets parameter even if it already has desired value)
- Improved usability by allowing raw MIDI pattern (e.g. sysex) to be edited in separate editor window which also indicates whether the pattern is valid (both in source and target)
- Improved takeover modes substantially by applying the "mdmayfield improvements": No more backwards jumps! Much less getting-stuck situations! Ability to choose a fixed default for jump max! (Thanks a lot to mdmayfield who made the initial contribution!)
- Improved usability by removing "Jump min/max" settings and introducing an "Off" mode instead (the value for jump max is now an implementation detail; custom min/max values are still supported but only for old presets to ensure backward compatibility; one can use a value sequence as alternative to jump min)
- Improved auto-load mode by automagically falling back to memorized mappings when FX loses focus (users will love this because it's much more intuitive than "Make instance superior", which still has its uses though in more complex scenarios where you want multiple instances)
- Improved wording by consistently using "Browse ..." instead of "Navigate within ..." or "Cycle through ..."
- Improved wording by using less technical object selector names (e.g. "Particular" instead of "By ID")
- Improved usability by displaying in status bar if control/feedback globally off (don't show by greying out mapping rows anymore)
- Improved usability by insisting on keyboard focus, even if 'Send all keyboard focus to plug-in' is disabled
- Improved target-based conditional activation by listening to target activation/deactivation as well
- Improved usability by marking targets that support MIDI real-time control (because MIDI real-time control has a few restrictions)
- Improved source "MIDI script" when used with Lua language by making color information available (allows users to provide support for arbitrary MIDI color LEDs/displays, in addition to the built-in ones)
- Improved target logging by including target control errors and other information
- Improved usability by making it possible to copy and paste the activation condition of a mapping
- Improved preset loading by supporting placing preset files in sub directories (1 level, ATTENTION: The parent directory will become part of the preset ID, so don't move existing presets!)
- Improved preset loading by supporting symlinked preset files
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by respecting the "Reverse" checkbox when loading the default value (great for changing the perspective when it comes to on/off targets)
- Improved usability of the snapshot targets by displaying the snapshot ID in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by displaying the parameter index in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by making the parameter learnable
- Improved usability by making text feedback available with dummy target (great for sending just some constant text or using placeholders that don't need target context)
- Improved usability by displaying session ID in the status bar (should help detecting duplicate IDs, which can be useful e.g. when using projection)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by enabling feedback (showing if the desired snapshot is currently loaded or not)
- Improved versatility of target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" by making trigger-like actions controllable by relative endless encoders (via invocation mode "Trigger")
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot" by adding the "Last loaded" selector (great for assigning a particular button to update the currently loaded snapshot)
- Fixed missing feedback of "FX: Enable/disable" target when Bypass parameter is automated
- Fixed FX still being considered as focused when focus is changed from the FX window to the main area
- Fixed track peak target not respecting solo state of other tracks
- Fixed action target invocation mode 7-bit/14-bit confusion (existing presets will automatically be migrated, so existing behavior will not change)
- Fixed failed scan on macOS El Capitan (ReaLearn stopped working on it since v2.13, fixed by removing Prometheus metrics support for macOS Intel builds)
- Fixed unreliable refresh of dynamic track result UI refresh in target section of mapping panel
- Fixed various mapping panel GUI bugs
- Fixed missing feedback refresh when dealing with multiple instances (e.g. via "Make instance superior")
- Fixed missing automatic feedback for target "FX: Set online/offline"
- Fixed unreliable track visibility change detection
- Fixed rel\_time transformations to respect reverse, target min/max/sequence and rounding (also hide some settings that don't make sense)
- Fixed OSC compatibility with certain apps such as Syntien (control didn't work when both control and feedback were enabled for the device)
- Fixed target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" invocation mode "Trigger" (could potentially suffer from not being retriggered in some situations)
- Fixed bug that caused retriggerable targets to not be retriggered with relative control if they already had the desired value
- Fixed error when learning/using special keys on macOS (keyboard source)
- Fixed REAPER track color detection
- Fixed bug that caused parameters and custom projection data to not be cleared when switching preset to None
- Fixed fire modes when using rel\_time transitions
- Fixed saving of snapshot IDs in target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Fixed feedback of target "Marker/region: Go to" (it was changing even when playback was stopped)
- Fixed ReaLearn still being active when disabling it via its automatable "Bypass" parameter (as opposed to disabling it via checkbox or ReaScript)
- Fixed deletion of mapping snapshots when copying and pasting a compartment
- Fixed "mapping not found" error when removing a mapping while still learning it
- Fixed infinite error loop and certain "track is not available"-like errors
- Fixed change detection for FX on the monitoring FX chain (most importantly enable/disable, in general ReaLearn should now work much better when targeting monitoring FX and also work better if it's placed on the monitoring FX chain itself)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Internal change: Migrated to Rust 1.65.0
- Added new MIDI source "Specific program change" (which makes it more straightforward to react to specific programs)
- Added dynamic track expression variables "instance\_track\_tcp\_index" and "instance\_track\_mcp\_index"
- Improved usability by allowing raw MIDI pattern (e.g. sysex) to be edited in separate editor window which also indicates whether the pattern is valid (both in source and target)
- Fixed FX still being considered as focused when focus is changed from the FX window to the main area
- Fixed track peak target not respecting solo state of other tracks
- Fixed action target invocation mode 7-bit/14-bit confusion (existing presets will automatically be migrated, so existing behavior will not change)
- Fixed failed scan on macOS El Capitan (ReaLearn stopped working on it since v2.13, fixed by removing Prometheus metrics support for macOS Intel builds)
- Fixed crash when pressing a key on older macOS installations (a problem since 2.14.0-pre.6)
- Fixed unreliable refresh of dynamic track result UI refresh in target section of mapping panel
- Fixed failing NKS sub filter item gathering in pot target

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added menu and help buttons to the header panel
- Added previous/next buttons to the mapping panel (for navigating in the list of mappings that's currently visible in the main panel)
- Added more comfortable editing for OSC feedback arguments and help button
- Added Lua snippet versioning (from now on, all Lua exports from ReaLearn will contain the ReaLearn version number; used for getting version conflict warnings on import and applying migration logic; in your own Lua code, you should make sure it's set from now on ... removing it will make ReaLearn think that it's an old preset and then it might apply some migration logic that you don't want)
- Added new takeover mode "Pickup (tolerant)" (prevents jumps but also makes extra sure the target doesn't get stuck, in addition to below mdmayfield improvements)
- Added new text feedback placeholder "target.width.mcu" to target "Track: Set stereo width" for pretty display of width value
- Improved takeover modes substantially by applying the "mdmayfield improvements": No more backwards jumps! Much less getting-stuck situations! Ability to choose a fixed default for jump max! (Thanks a lot to mdmayfield who made the initial contribution!)
- Improved usability by removing "Jump min/max" settings and introducing an "Off" mode instead (the value for jump max is now an implementation detail; custom min/max values are still supported but only for old presets to ensure backward compatibility; one can use a value sequence as alternative to jump min)
- Improved auto-load mode by automagically falling back to memorized mappings when FX loses focus (users will love this because it's much more intuitive than "Make instance superior", which still has its uses though in more complex scenarios where you want multiple instances)
- Improved selection ganging and grouping support for track targets by lifting the last remaining limitations (e.g. that it was not possible for phase/invert or that sometimes only both are supported at the same time ... needs REAPER 6.69+dev1102)
- Fixed buggy dynamic track expression variables selected\_track\_tcp\_index and selected\_track\_mcp\_index
- Fixed incorrect mapping row labels for new track selectors
- Fixed missing feedback refresh when dealing with multiple instances (e.g. via "Make instance superior")
- Fixed missing automatic feedback for target "FX: Set online/offline"
- Fixed FX enable/disable target learning, it was picking it up as Bypass parameter (pre-release regression)

- Added option to enable/disable selection ganging to supported track targets
- Added target control information to mapping panel (Very useful to understand what's going on! For real-time-MIDI-controlled mappings, this only works if target control logging is enabled.)
- Improved target-based conditional activation by listening to target activation/deactivation as well
- Improved usability by marking targets that support MIDI real-time control (because MIDI real-time control has a few restrictions)
- Fixed bug that caused retriggerable targets to not be retriggered with relative control if they already had the desired value

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Internal change: Migrated to Rust 1.63.0
- Added display type "Studiologic SL Keyboard display" for showing arbitrary text on the keyboard (tested with SL88)
- Added display types "X-Touch Mackie LCD" and "X-Touch Mackie LCD XT" for enabling LCD color support when certain X-Touch devices are in MCU mode
- Added various options to decide whether to keep ReaLearn active if its project tab is in the background (accessible via right-click menu)
- Added option to play sound when target has been invoked successfully ("Beep on success" checkbox at the bottom left of the mapping panel, great for trigger-like targets such as saving a snapshot)
- Added target "Track: Enable/disable parent send" (great for MIDI routing in the context of song switching)
- Added option to prevent resetting feedback when releasing sources (accessible via right-click menu, good for using REAPER/ReaLearn as a remote control for hardware devices)
- Added stop function to be used in control transformation formulas to emit a target value and stop the currently running transition at once
- Added context menu entry "Open preset folder"
- Added "Retrigger" option to target "FX parameter: Set value" (sets parameter even if it already has desired value)
- Improved preset loading by supporting placing preset files in sub directories (1 level, ATTENTION: The parent directory will become part of the preset ID, so don't move existing presets!)
- Improved preset loading by supporting symlinked preset files
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by respecting the "Reverse" checkbox when loading the default value (great for changing the perspective when it comes to on/off targets)
- Improved usability of the snapshot targets by displaying the snapshot ID in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by displaying the parameter index in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by making the parameter learnable
- Improved usability by making text feedback available with dummy target (great for sending just some constant text or using placeholders that don't need target context)
- Improved usability by displaying session ID in the status bar (should help detecting duplicate IDs, which can be useful e.g. when using projection)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by enabling feedback (showing if the desired snapshot is currently loaded or not)
- Improved versatility of target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" by making trigger-like actions controllable by relative endless encoders (via invocation mode "Trigger")
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot" by adding the "Last loaded" selector (great for assigning a particular button to update the currently loaded snapshot)
- Fixed saving of snapshot IDs in target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Fixed feedback of target "Marker/region: Go to" (it was changing even when playback was stopped)
- Fixed ReaLearn still being active when disabling it via its automatable "Bypass" parameter (as opposed to disabling it via checkbox or ReaScript)
- Fixed deletion of mapping snapshots when copying and pasting a compartment
- Fixed "mapping not found" error when removing a mapping while still learning it
- Fixed infinite error loop and certain "track is not available"-like errors
- Fixed change detection for FX on the monitoring FX chain (most importantly enable/disable, in general ReaLearn should now work much better when targeting monitoring FX and also work better if it's placed on the monitoring FX chain itself)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Internal change: Migrate to Rust 1.61
- Added target-based conditional activation
- Added target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Added "Keyboard" source
- Added new "Instance track" concept, a corresponding track selector \<Instance> and a way to set the instance track (this enables many new scenarios such as track pinning)
- Added new "Instance FX" concept, a corresponding FX selector \<Instance> and a way to set the instance FX (this enables many new scenarios such as FX pinning)
- Added absolute mode "Make relative" for turning absolute fader/knob movements into relative target adjustments
- Added absolute mode "Performance control" for emulating the behavior of a typical soft synth modulation matrix mapping
- Added source "Timer" for repeated triggering of arbitrary targets (you can find it in source category "REAPER", can for example be used to repeatedly send a particular OSC message, which is a precondition to support Behringer X32 OSC)
- Added new source "ReaLearn parameter" in source category "REAPER" (for controlling targets with ReaLearn's automatable parameters itself)
- Added initial accessibility (Thanks a lot to AZSlow3 for his contribution!)
- Added possibility to address an FX instance relative to the current ReaLearn instance by using dynamic FX expression variable this\_fx\_index
- Added instance\_track\_index and instance\_fx\_index variables to dynamic expressions (allows us cycling through tracks/FX while pinning them as instance track/FX)
- Added "FX" target (analogously to "Track" target, well-suited for text feedback concerning a particular FX)
- Added possibility to modulate ReaLearn target values and smooth transitions by making the rel\_time variable available in control transformation formulas (read more on the issue tracker or in the user guide)
- Added "ReaLearn: Dummy" target
- Added support for Mackie Extender (XT) displays
- Added option to log target control values (available in header panel context menu)
- Added possibility to target FX parameters shown in track control panel by using the new variables tcp\_fx\_indexes and tcp\_fx\_parameter\_indexes in dynamic FX and FX parameter expressions
- Added context menu action "Dry-run Lua script from clipboard"
- Added support for importing JSON presets via "Import from clipboard"
- Added possibility to write MIDI scripts in Lua
- Added possibility to map text feedback to numeric source values (API-only, feedback\_value\_table)
- Added new activation condition type "Expression" (which lets one use the same expression language in activation conditions that's also used for dynamic selectors)
- Added comprehensive support for discrete ReaLearn parameters (now you can use integers instead of only floating pointer numbers between 0.0 and 1.0)
- Added target "FX parameter: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Send: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Track: Set monitoring mode"
- Added support for instance-specific "FX-to-preset links" (making it possible to distinguish between different controllers when using "Auto-load: Depending on focused FX")
- Added support for OSC value ranges other than 0.0 to 1.0
- Added support for OSC type tags Int and Long
- Added new context menu action "Named listed mappings after source"
- Added limited support for offline rendering (works now with REAPER >= v6.52+dev0323, limited to controlling FX parameters on the same track)
- Added option in context menu to log not just real but also incoming/outgoing virtual control elements and values (very useful for debugging mappings)
- Added invocation mode "Absolute (7-bit)" to target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" (for controlling actions that don't correctly interpret 14-bit values, e.g. "SWS/SM: Live Config #1 - Apply config (MIDI/OSC only)")
- Added plug'n'play for MIDI devices, also on Windows (automatically resends all feedback shortly after MIDI device plugged in without further user interaction)
- Added John's presets for Behringer MOTÖR and FCB1010
- Added clip engine to be used by upcoming Playtime 2
- Improved target "MIDI: Send message" by lifting all previous restrictions when using destination "FX output" (Yes, you can now play your VSTs via OSC!)
- Improved precision for entering and displaying percentages and dB to 4 fractional digits (e.g. useful for values in value sequences)
- Improved error reporting by including the name of the channel in case a channel ran full
- Improved ReaLearn plug-in topology by removing output pins (since ReaLearn doesn't output any audio streams)
- Improved keyboard source significantly (save/load, more reliable key catching, catching of modifier-only key presses, keystroke normalization for better cross-platform experience, portability warnings)
- Improved selectors "All by name" and "All selected" by allowing combinatorial explosion (you can now easily target many FX, FX parameters and sends on many tracks with just one target ... powerful, use with caution!)
- Improved OSC by using one socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (makes "respond to sender" possible, used for example by Behringer XR mixers)
- Improved user interface on macOS by taking up less vertical screen space (and a tiny bit less horizontal one, too)
- Improved (or made worse?) user interface for macOS light mode by using an ugly but at least bright scrollbar
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by making the number of banks configurable (by entering a value count for the corresponding ReaLearn parameter)
- Improved performance when automating ReaLearn parameters by not processing value updates if value didn't change
- Improved user interface layout for OSC source and target "OSC: Send message"
- Improved dropdown menu for choosing an absolute mode by adding "NOT APPLICABLE" if the mode doesn't make sense under the current conditions
- Temporarily switched of auto-correction of absolute modes to see if users miss it or we can just throw it out
- Improved usability by reducing height of mapping panel on Windows and macOS (also vastly improved GUI dialog development tooling to gain more flexibility for GUI modifications)
- Improved wording of log actions and log messages
- Improved usability by using text field to enter marker/region position
- Improved accuracy when using relative mode with continuous target by not exceeding target min/max
- Improved "Auto-load preset" feature to be more generic. It now works on the current instance FX instead of just on the currently focused FX (allows much more flexible auto-loading)
- Improved usability by making trigger-like targets controllable with encoders (by default, each encoder increment/decrement will trigger the target)
- Improved virtual source label in mapping row
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" to be able to load manually taken mapping snapshots and set default values
- Improved error reporting if session could not be restored (now logs session JSON)
- Improved usability by making None the default source and dummy target the default target
- Improved GUI dimensions on Linux, Windows and macOS
- Improved virtual feedback message logging by logging them even if no match found
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by showing value labels of discrete parameters as bank names
- Improved projection by making it possible to use without saving a controller preset (projection widget settings are now saved together with the ReaLearn instance)
- Improved UI by adding link to list of tested controllers in help menu
- Improved UI by refreshing input/output dropdowns on MIDI device changes
- Fixed backward compatibility to some old presets that use JSON null instead of omitting properties
- Fixed learning/filtering for Arturia encoders in relative mode
- Fixed accumulated control and possible errors after rendering
- Fixed cut-off MIDI device names
- Fixed error 'Only one of step\_size\_interval and step\_factor\_interval can be set' on Lua import
- Fixed "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" for default group
- Fixed long-standing serious GUI lags when modifying multiple tracks at once
- Fixed target incorrect track peaks when using "Track: Peak" target with multi-channel tracks (Thanks a lot to AlbertoV5's contribution!)
- Fixed missing update when changing FX in FX-related targets
- Fixed missing text feedback updates when using placeholder target.fx.name and target.fx.index
- Fixed "channel full" messages on high load (e.g. selecting many tracks at once) and improved initial memory consumption
- Fixed error when using plug-ins with non-UTF8 names
- Fixed feedback for virtual controller mappings by sending "Off" when not in use
- Fixed feedback for virtual controller mappings if they are inactive
- Fixed missing feedback on activation changes when replacing all parameters
- Fixed bug that caused enabling/disabling ReaLearn to have no effect when on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed white background color when using dark SWELL settings on Linux (by not enforcing any background color at all)
- Fixed bug in target "MIDI: Send message" that made repeated sending of the same value have no effect with some configurations
- Fixed sometimes missing text feedback updates for clip seek target and some other targets
- Fixed some potential errors when using "Copy as Lua"
- Fixed bug when combining conditional activation with single press fire mode (modifier firing unexpectedly)
- Removed most of the support for the experimental legacy clip targets (replaced with the new clip engine, which is not completely compatible with the experimental legacy clip targets)

            <version name="2.13.0-pre.2" author="helgoboss" time="2022-04-05T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added comprehensive support for discrete ReaLearn parameters (now you can use integers instead of only floating pointer numbers between 0.0 and 1.0)
- Added target "FX parameter: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Send: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Track: Set monitoring mode"
- Added support for instance-specific "FX-to-preset links" (making it possible to distinguish between different controllers when using "Auto-load: Depending on focused FX")
- Added support for OSC value ranges other than 0.0 to 1.0
- Added support for OSC type tags Int and Long
- Added new context menu action "Named listed mappings after source"
- Improved keyboard source significantly (save/load, more reliable key catching, catching of modifier-only key presses, keystroke normalization for better cross-platform experience, portability warnings)
- Improved selectors "All by name" and "All selected" by allowing combinatorial explosion (you can now easily target many FX, FX parameters and sends on many tracks with just one target ... powerful, use with caution!)
- Improved OSC by using one socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (makes "respond to sender" possible, used for example by Behringer XR mixers)
- Improved user interface on macOS by taking up less vertical screen space (and a tiny bit less horizontal one, too)
- Improved (or made worse?) user interface for macOS light mode by using an ugly but at least bright scrollbar
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by making the number of banks configurable (by entering a value count for the corresponding ReaLearn parameter)
- Improved performance when automating ReaLearn parameters by not processing value updates if value didn't change
- Improved user interface layout for OSC source and target "OSC: Send message"

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added limited support for offline rendering (works now with REAPER >= v6.52+dev0323, limited to controlling FX parameters on the same track)
- Added source "Timer" for repeated triggering of arbitrary targets (you can find it in source category "REAPER", can for example be used to repeatedly send a particular OSC message, which is a precondition to support Behringer X32 OSC)
- Added work-in-progress "Keyboard" source (NO SAVE of source settings yet!)
- Added option in context menu to log not just real but also incoming/outgoing virtual control elements and values (very useful for debugging mappings)
- Added invocation mode "Absolute (7-bit)" to target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" (for controlling actions that don't correctly interpret 14-bit values, e.g. "SWS/SM: Live Config #1 - Apply config (MIDI/OSC only)")
- Added plug'n'play for MIDI devices, also on Windows (automatically resends all feedback shortly after MIDI device plugged in without further user interaction)
- Added John's presets for Behringer MOTÖR and FCB1010
- Added clip engine to be used by upcoming Playtime 2 (this is by far the biggest addition but you can't use it yet :P ... more about this in the next pre-release)
- Improved target "MIDI: Send message" by lifting all previous restrictions when using destination "FX output" (Yes, you can now play your VSTs via OSC!)
- Improved precision for entering and displaying percentages and dB to 4 fractional digits (e.g. useful for values in value sequences)
- Improved error reporting by including the name of the channel in case a channel ran full
- Improved ReaLearn plug-in topology by removing output pins (since ReaLearn doesn't output any audio streams)
- Fixed bug that caused enabling/disabling ReaLearn to have no effect when on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed white background color when using dark SWELL settings on Linux (by not enforcing any background color at all)
- Fixed bug in target "MIDI: Send message" that made repeated sending of the same value have no effect with some configurations
- Fixed sometimes missing text feedback updates for clip seek target and some other targets
- Fixed some potential errors when using "Copy as Lua"
- Fixed bug when combining conditional activation with single press fire mode (modifier firing unexpectedly)
- Removed most of the support for the experimental legacy clip targets (replaced with the new clip engine, which is not completely compatible with the experimental legacy clip targets)

            <version name="2.11.1" author="helgoboss" time="2021-12-22T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added support for textual feedback (usable with OSC String sources and MIDI hardware displays: Mackie, SiniCon)
- Added comprehensive built-in support for import and export of the all-new ReaLearn Script = Build ReaLearn presets/mappings in Lua! (Attention: Small adjustments to the ReaLearn Script API data structure are to be expected during the 2.11 and 2.12 release cycles!)
- Added completely new possibility to organize mappings - by tagging them (most new ReaLearn targets support tags to flexibly restrict the mapping scope, you can also search for them by prefixing a search term with a hash character #)
- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable instances" for flexibly enabling/disabling complete ReaLearn instances during a performance (great for paging)
- Added target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable mappings" for flexibly enabling/disabling mappings during a performance (can be used as a more straightforward alternative to conditional activation, especially when it comes to bank/zone switching scenarios)
- Added target "ReaLearn: Navigate within group" for cycling through mappings in a mapping group (for intuitively defining sequences e.g. for implementing pages, zones etc.; support sequences spanning completely different targets!)
- Added possibility to control using system-exclusive MIDI messages (by using the existing very flexible "Raw MIDI" source, which only worked for feedback direction so far - now supports learning, value extraction using patterns and logging of incoming messages)
- Added text and background color support for some MIDI controller displays that have color capabilities (at the moment SiniCon E24 and Launchpad Pro)
- Added support for Raspberry Pi (Linux armv7 and Linux aarch64)
- Added new variable 'y\_last' in EEL control transformation, which can be used to implement a performance control mode typical for a synth modulation matrix (y = y\_last + x \* (1 - y\_last))
- Added variable 'selected\_track\_indexes' array variable to dynamic expressions (making it possible to e.g. control 1st selected track with fader one, 2nd selected track with fader two, etc.)
- Added new "Track" target which is well-suited as neutral target for getting textual feedback for track properties (but will get more interesting functionality at a later stage, see #228)
- Added JSON schema of the API data structure (in order to potentially support writing ReaLearn presets/mappings in other languages as well, especially typed ones, e.g. TypeScript)
- Added header panel context menu action 'Make sources of all main mappings virtual'
- Added optional track dropdown to "Project: Invoke REAPER action" target (The target makes sure that this track is selected before executing the action. This makes it possible to combine ReaLearn's flexible track selection capabilities with the plethora of REAPER actions that work on the currently selected track.)
- Added target "Send: Automation mode"
- Added target "Send: Mono/stereo"
- Added target "Send: Phase invert/normal"
- Added target "Track: Phase invert/normal"
- Added target "Project: Any on (solo/mute/...)"
- Added "exclusive (on only)" options wherever appropriate in order to easily support exclusive toggle buttons (group interaction "inverse target value", track exclusivity, mapping/instance enable/disable exclusivity)
- Added support for (N)RPN data increment/decrement messages
- Added source "ReaLearn instance started" in source category REAPER that fires when ReaLearn is started (can be used to execute an action, restore parameter states or whatever on REAPER startup or project load)
- Added basic support for displaying scrollable text on the Launchpad Pro (also supports text color)
- Added \<New group> option to "Move to group" context menu actions
- Added place in Git repository for making unofficial 3rd-party presets available (added 2 unofficial controller presets for BCF2000 and Panorama P6)
- Added header panel context menu action 'Make targets of listed mappings sticky'
- Improved "DAW control" main preset (added support for timecode display, time mode cycling, track name and pan display, any-solo, track peak meter, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" controller presets (added support for LCD and timecode display, track peak meter and any-solo button, fixed encoder acceleration behavior, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved performance, code complexity and serialization independence of preset dirty checking by using a much simpler method than before (before: comparison of JSON; now: setting dirty flag whenever e.g. a mapping changed)
- Improved virtual control element naming by increasing maximum length from 16 to 32
- Improved wording by renaming "Tuning" to "Glue"
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by allowing to restrict snapshot loading to mappings with certain tags and activity state
- Improved auto-load preset functionality to work better with shell plug-ins, e.g. Waves (now by default uses plug-in name instead of file name to distinguish between the single plug-in types; in order for this to take effect, you need to remove each problematic link and reestablish it or edit the link and fill out the FX ID name yourself)
- Improved projection feedback by sending feedback initially, not just on value changes or on manual request via REAPER action
- Improved target value entry by providing buttons for trigger- or switch-like targets
- Improved "Toggle buttons" mode to support exclusive toggle button use cases (if target min is equal to target max, it now toggles between that specific value and zero)
- Improved \<Dynamic> track selector by allowing it to address the master track (if the expression returns value -1)
- Improved dynamic expressions by letting 'track\_selected\_index' evaluate to the special variable 'none' if no track is selected, allowing users to choose a suitable fallback in that case
- Improved dynamic expressions by making 'selected\_track\_index' and 'this\_track\_index' support master track (value -1)
- Improved dynamic expressions by making compartment parameters available as array variable 'p' (now you can write p\[0] instead of p1])
- Improved dynamic expressions by making target inactive if the expression fails (e.g. if an undefined variable is used)
- Improved Raw MIDI source to control and learn incoming short (non-sys-ex) messages as well
- Improved documentation of what's special about "MIDI: Send message" target and what limitations it has
- Improved performance of "MIDI: Send message" target when sending to feedback output by avoiding deallocation in audio thread
- Improved usability by disabling certain UI elements depending on the selected OSC argument type
- Improved user guide (structure, headings, table of contents, TouchOSC instructions)
- Fixed bug that caused project to be marked dirty on load already
- Fixed bug that caused changes to sometimes not be memorized if ReaLearn is on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed bug that caused automation to shortly jump back when writing automation via fader touch
- Fixed severe bug that could cause ReaLearn instances to receive MIDI from wrong input device
- Fixed bug that caused source takeover between ReaLearn instances with different feedback output devices

- Added new target "ReaLearn: Navigate within group" for cycling through mappings in a mapping group (for intuitively defining sequences e.g. for implementing pages, zones etc.; support sequences spanning completely different targets!)
- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable mappings" for flexibly enabling/disabling mappings during a performance (can be used as a more straightforward alternative to conditional activation, especially when it comes to bank/zone switching scenarios)
- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable instances" for flexibly enabling/disabling complete ReaLearn instances during a performance (great for paging)
- Added completely new possibility to organize mappings - by tagging them (most new ReaLearn targets support tags to flexibly restrict the mapping scope, you can also search for them by prefixing a search term with a hash character #)
- Added new source "ReaLearn instance started" in source category REAPER that fires when ReaLearn is started (can be used to execute an actions, restore parameter states or whatever on REAPER startup or project load)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by allowing to restrict snapshot loading to mappings with certain tags and activity state
- Improved target value entry by providing buttons for trigger- or switch-like targets
- Improved projection feedback by sending feedback initially, not just on value changes or on manual request via REAPER action
- Improved performance of "MIDI: Send message" target when sending to feedback output by avoiding deallocation in audio thread
- Improved documentation of what's special about "MIDI: Send message" target and what limitations it has

            <version name="2.10.0" author="helgoboss" time="2021-09-06T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added option "Poll for feedback" (enabled by default) to the few targets for which the REAPER API doesn't provide any value change notification or not in all cases (essentially makes automatic feedback work for all targets, also fixes the issue that switching presets from within a FX UI doesn't resend FX parameter feedback)
- Added header context menu options to log incoming/outgoing MIDI/OSC messages (great for debugging)
- Added track selector "All by name" which resolves to many tracks instead of only the first one if the name contains wildcards and multiple tracks match
- Added mapping row context menu option to log debug info for a single mapping
- Added new tuning setting "Group interaction" for controlling multiple mappings within the same group at once, in multiple interesting ways
- Added source category "None", to be used with mappings that are not supposed to be controlled directly but just via "Group interaction"
- Added support for target value sequences (including ranges, customizable step sizes etc., even supports true relative control!)
- Added target unit button for switching between 1. native target unit and 2. percentages (chosen unit will be used whenever entering/displaying target values or step sizes, saved per mapping)
- Added visual mapping (source) match indicator, both in mapping row and mapping panel
- Added "All by name" FX selector (lets you use wildcards now to resolve to multiple FX, quite useful with the "FX: Enable/disable" target for simulating controller pages)
- Added possibility to use ReaLearn as global MIDI filter (by making "Let through" checkboxes available even when choosing real hardware MIDI input device, needs REAPER >= v6.36!)
- Added source "MIDI device changes" in new source category "REAPER" (for reacting to MIDI device plug/unplug events)
- Added variable selected\_track\_index for use in dynamic track expression
- Added a very work-in-progress version of the new "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" target (only restores the initial target values of all instance mappings at the moment but will become much more powerful in future)
- Internal change: Added and changed code for upcoming "Discrete processing" feature (#184)
- Added mapping option "Show in projection" (enabled by default)
- Added controller preset and instructions for "Arturia KeyLab MkII" (thanks to dissofiddle)
- Improved usability by putting "Send feedback after control" and "Prevent echo feedback" into dropdown (because it doesn't make sense to combine them)
- Improved versatility of "Make absolute" checkbox by also making it available in "Incremental buttons" mode
- Improved jump settings by displaying and letting one enter step sizes instead of absolute values (makes much more sense)
- Improved error handling by logging details when not being able to load a preset
- Improved error handling by displaying instructions on what to do when encountering a preset saved with a newer version
- Improved error handling by logging only the first warning message in a sequence of equal warning messages
- Improved UI semantics by renaming target category "REAPER" to "Real"
- Improved usability by disallowing addressing FX "By ID" if the track is not sticky (that is, not \<This> or addressed "By ID") ... allowing was nonsensical and confusing
- Improved FX parameter "By position" selector so you can enter the position in a text field (parameter dropdown is now available as selector "By ID")
- Improved consistency of target label in mapping row (e.g. don't show resolved track/FX/parameter name if selector is not "By ID")
- Improved usability of target dropdowns by making it possible to change the track/FX selectors while keeping entered values (e.g. having the name always prefilled when switching from "By ID" to "By name")
- Improved user guide (better table of contents, better quick start, migrated to AsciiDoc)
- Improved projection by sending projection feedback even if feedback disabled for controller mapping
- Improved fire mode "After timeout" by making it work in combination with "Press only" button filter (you can now press a button and no matter how long you press it, it will fire after the specified timeout)
- Improved versatility by guaranteeing mappings within one compartment to be processed in the order of definition (exception: ReaLearn parameters)
- Improved "MIDI/OSC: Send message" targets by making it work with "Toggle buttons" mode and relative encoders
- Improved performance for targets that poll for feedback (e.g. "Track: Peak") by processing and sending feedback only if value actually changed
- Improved reliability by migrating to stable Rust (just an internal change)
- Fixed "nervous motor faders" issue by not sending batch feedback anymore when starting to play or seeking
- Fixed predefined "MIDI: Send" target patterns (7-bit patterns reported to be 14-bit-capable)
- Fixed takeover modes misbehavior in presence of restricted source/target value range
- Fixed bug that let "Send feedback after control" not send feedback after control in some corner cases
- Fixed "Last touched" target: Make it work correctly if other FX parameter is currently automated (also improves FX parameter learning in presence of parameter automation)
- Fixed error "REAPER string should be UTF-8 encoded" with certain FX parameter names
- Fixed bug that caused "The pipe is being closed" error on some systems when choosing "MIDI: Send message" target
- Fixed non-reliable dynamic selectors for send, FX and FX parameters (was only working reliably for tracks before)
- Fixed MiniLab mkII controller preset: Projection feedback for pads works now
- Fixed confusing logic that caused the preset save button to not be greyed out after making mappings project-independent
- Fixed lag when sending MIDI messages to FX output (both when letting incoming messages through and when sending them via "MIDI: Send message" target)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn send targets to forget the kind of send

- Added target unit button for switching between 1. native target unit and 2. percentages (chosen unit will be used whenever entering/displaying target values or step sizes, saved per mapping)
- Improved versatility of "Make absolute" checkbox by also making it available in "Incremental buttons" mode
- Improved jump settings by displaying and letting one enter step sizes instead of absolute values (makes much more sense)

- Added header context menu options to log incoming/outgoing MIDI/OSC messages (great for debugging)
- Added track selector "All by name" which resolves to many tracks instead of only the first one if the name contains wildcards and multiple tracks match
- Added mapping row context menu option to log debug info for a single mapping
- Improved performance for targets that poll for feedback (e.g. "Track: Peak") by processing and sending feedback only if value actually changed
- Improved reliability by migrating to stable Rust (just an internal change)
- Fixed "nervous motor faders" issue by not sending batch feedback anymore when starting to play or seeking
- Fixed predefined "MIDI: Send" target patterns (7-bit patterns reported to be 14-bit-capable)

            <version name="2.8.1" author="helgoboss" time="2021-04-27T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added experimental targets "Clip: Invoke transport action", "Clip: Seek" and "Clip: Volume"
- Added new FX instance selector "Dynamic"
- Added new FX parameter selectors "Dynamic" and "By name"
- Added new send/receive/output selectors "Dynamic", "By ID" (source/destination track ID) and "By name"
- Added option to use track receives (change of perspective) and hardware output sends instead of track sends only
- Added possibility to use wildcards (\* and ?) in all name selectors to match only parts of names
- Added "Fire after timeout" mode for button presses
- Added "Fire after timeout, keep firing" mode for button presses (turbo mode!)
- Added "Seek" target (including feedback on beat changes or in high resolution!)
- Added support for showing current target values in projection view (= "Projection feedback", needs latest version of the ReaLearn Companion app to work)
- Added takeover modes "Parallel" and "Catch up" (renamed existing takeover modes to "Pick up" and "Long time no see")
- Added FX selector \<This> for targeting the own ReaLearn instance (good for using conditional activation and \<Dynamic> in reusable presets)
- Added copy/paste of mappings or even just sources/modes/targets (also across compartments and instances)
- Added copy/paste of the complete filtered mapping list (e.g. to copy/paste whole compartments, groups or search results)
- Added possibility to use names for virtual control elements instead of numbers
- Added quick start section at the top of the user guide
- Added FAQ section to the user guide
- Added mapping group feature to controller compartment (was previously available in main compartment only)
- Added conditional activation to controller compartment (was previously available in main compartment only)
- Added 100 more freely assignable VST parameters to ReaLearn (now we have 200 parameters in total divided into the already existing 100 main compartment parameters and 100 new controller compartment parameters)
- Added possibility to customize parameter names via header panel context menu
- Added ability for "Auto-load preset: Depending on focused FX" instances to suspend other instances that share the same device (with this, you can easily let your controller control the currently focused FX but fall back to your usual controls when it's closed)
- Added ability that multiple instances work hand in hand when it comes to feedback (As long as 2 instances don't actively feedback to more than one control element at once, everything will be fine and should work just as with conditional activation within 1 instance.)
- Added new targets "FX open" (for opening/closing a specific FX via button) and "FX navigate" (for navigating with prev/next buttons or encoders within FX chain)
- Added new targets "Track automation mode" and "Automation mode override"
- Added new target "Track show/hide"
- Added new transport actions "Pause" and "Stop" to "Transport target" (for more fine-grained feedback)
- Added checkboxes "Scroll TCP" and "Scroll mixer" to targets "Selected track" and "Track selection"
- Added checkboxes "Set loop points" and "Set time selection" to target "Go to region"
- Added "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" to header context menu
- Added "FX-to-preset links" to header context menu for better management and for making it possible to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset
- Added possibility to use plug-in file name wildcards (\* and ?) when linking an FX to a preset (another way to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset)
- Added new source character "Toggle button" as a workaround for hardware buttons that can't be configured to act as momentary buttons (should usually be avoided; behavior is that it always sends 1 even when 0 is received)
- Added new fire modes "Single press" and "Double press" (can now distinguish between single press, double press and long press)
- Added possibility to use preset name in addition to plug-in name when creating preset links for the "Auto-load preset" feature (allows you to load a different ReaLearn main preset when the preset of the focused FX changes)
- Added ability to correctly switch feedback when enabling/disabling ReaLearn instances that talk to the same control elements (uses source-takeover mechanism)
- Added possibility to easily react to button press-down only and ignore button release (without affecting feedback)
- Added possibility to easily react to encoder increments or decrements only
- Added possibility to let the target track depend on the current position of this ReaLearn track by making variable this\_track\_index available in the \<Dynamic> track expression
- Added support for keeping control/feedback working even when switching to other project tab (with exception of automation writing, "Project: Set playrate" target and the smooth region seeking part of "Marker/region: Go to" target)
- Added possibility to enforce "Rotate" already in a virtual controller mapping
- Added feedback-only "Script" MIDI source for making LCD support possible (lets you write EEL scripts that encode the target value as raw MIDI message in any imaginable way)
- Added library of Mackie-inspired virtual control element names and a convenient picker
- Added capability for automatic naming of mappings based on its target - kicks in when clearing the custom name
- Added right-click menu action to auto-name listed mappings (clearing all names)
- Added main preset "DAW Control" to ReaPack repository and documented it in the user guide in the new "Preset" section
- Added user guide entry for controller "Behringer X-Touch One"
- Added support for wildcards in search expressions
- Added context-sensitive help section to mapping panel which explains most of the tuning options (for each kind of source separately)
- Added target "MIDI: Send message"
- Added target "OSC: Send message"
- Added new track selector "All selected" to make track targets (NOT FX and send targets) work on all selected tracks
- Added right-click menu action "Move listed mappings to group"
- Improved compartment presets by making them save/restore the customized compartment parameter names as well
- Improved feedback for controller mappings with virtual targets (enabling it again will restore feedback, that was previously not the case)
- Improved understandability by renaming "Program" to "Bank" in conditional activation
- Improved usability by renaming and reordering targets, also introduced additional target hint label
- Improved "Project: Invoke transport action" target by making "Play/stop" and "Play/pause" retriggerable
- Improved user interface by displaying helpful text and button if compartment, group or filtered list empty
- Improved user interface by moving "Reload all" to the header right-click context menu as "Reload all presets from disk"
- Improved user interface by displaying mapping compartments as radio buttons
- Improved user interface by hiding "Let through" options when input is not \<FX input> (change in behavior: now it will always let through FX input events in that case)
- Improved user interface by marking "Toggle buttons" mode as invalid for virtual controller mappings
- Improved versatility by making "Character" dropdown available even for 14-bit sources (both (N)RPN and CC)
- Improved controller presets "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" by using virtual control element names of the new "DAW" domain (major version bump, breaking change ... but no worries, your existing projects, FX chains and track templates will not be changed unless you explicitly reload the preset within ReaLearn)
- Improved usability by displaying mapping group name on right when showing mappings in all groups
- Improved "Duplicate" by getting rid of the annoying "Copy of ..." prefix
- Improved usability by hiding mapping tuning options which are not relevant at all in the current context
- Improved user friendliness by raising step size max to 5% and speed max to 5x (in order to make it more obvious to new users that ReaLearn supports encoder acceleration and velocity-sensitive buttons)
- Improved usability by removing the UI difference between numbered and named virtual control elements (internally numbers are still treated a bit differently, but on the surface it's the same now)
- Improved usability by explicitly indicating when target is currently inactive
- Improved naming by renaming "Rotate" to "Wrap" and "Move instance to upper floor" to "Make instance superior"
- Improved Midi Fighter Twister user guide entry by explaining how to use encoder acceleration and by linking to ReaLearn-compatible MFT Color Designer web app
- Improved Midi Fighter Twister controller presets by making it react to encoder acceleration if configured in MF utility (also use named virtual control IDs for side buttons)
- Improved preset behavior by automatically resetting all compartment parameters to zero when loading a compartment preset
- Improved global "Find first mapping by source" REAPER action by taking mapping activation status into account
- Fixed error when controlling "Last touched" target after the last touched target is gone (e.g. after track deleted)
- Fixed too early rotation when using "Incremental buttons" in combination with "Rotate"
- Fixed bug in "Go to marger/region" target that caused markers/regions to be triggered even on button release
- Fixed idle CPU usage when having OSC feedback enabled for at least one OSC device (was quite high)
- Fixed channel "Full" error when invoking lots of actions in a small amount of time
- Fixed possible "unwrap" error with certain mapping tuning settings, e.g. jump and step size
- Fixed possible "borrow" error when using FX parameter target with own ReaLearn instance
- Fixed feedback issues due to numerical inaccuracies (especially useful for radio-button-like feedback from discrete target values)
- Fixed "FX chain chunk not found" error when on monitoring FX and "Auto-load preset" on
- Fixed sometimes missing feedback on target activation changes (e.g. when "Track must be selected" is used)
- Fixed \<Dynamic> expression evaluation by doing rounding (was sometimes leading to unexpected results because decimal digits were just being cut off)
- Fixed cropped "Min" labels on macOS
- Fixed little GUI lag when selecting control element index for virtual targets
- Fixed bug on macOS which caused text fields not to update correctly if still focused
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error on macOS when doing things while text field still focused
- Fixed bug that caused "Last touched" target to not respond right after preset/project loading

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added context-sensitive help section to mapping panel which explains most of the tuning options (for each kind of source separately)
- Improved usability by hiding mapping tuning options which are not relevant at all in the current context
- Improved user friendliness by raising step size max to 5% and speed max to 5x (in order to make it more obvious to new users that ReaLearn supports encoder acceleration and velocity-sensitive buttons)
- Improved usability by removing the UI difference between numbered and named virtual control elements (internally numbers are still treated a bit differently, but on the surface it's the same now)
- Improved usability by making source pattern/script a single-line text field again (automatically greyed out as soon as value has multiple lines)
- Improved usability by explicitly indicating when target is currently inactive
- Improved naming by renaming "Rotate" to "Wrap" and "Move instance to upper floor" to "Make instance superior"
- Fixed bug on macOS which caused text fields not to update correctly if still focused
- Fixed default mapping group showing up as "Group not present" when viewing mappings in all groups
- Fixed incomplete mapping panel on Linux (was incomplete up since rc.1)

- Added library of Mackie-inspired virtual control element names and a convenient picker
- Added capability for automatic naming of mappings based on its target - kicks in when clearing the custom name
- Added right-click menu action to auto-name listed mappings (clearing all names)

- Added user guide entry for controller "Behringer X-Touch One"
- Added support for wildcards in search expressions
- Improved controller presets "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" by using virtual control element names of the new "DAW" domain (major version bump, breaking change ... but no worries, your existing projects, FX chains and track templates will not be changed unless you explicitly reload the preset within ReaLearn)
- Improved "What could I do to see some mappings?" suggestions if mapping list is empty and filter/group set
- Improved usability by displaying mapping group name on right when showing mappings in all groups

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new targets "FX open" (for opening/closing a specific FX via button) and "FX navigate" (for navigating with prev/next buttons or encoders within FX chain)
- Added new targets "Track automation mode" and "Automation mode override"
- Added new target "Track show/hide"
- Added new transport actions "Pause" and "Stop" to "Transport target" (for more fine-grained feedback)
- Added checkboxes "Scroll TCP" and "Scroll mixer" to targets "Selected track" and "Track selection"
- Added checkboxes "Set loop points" and "Set time selection" to target "Go to region"
- Added "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" to header context menu
- Added "FX-to-preset links" to header context menu for better management and for making it possible to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset
- Added possibility to use plug-in file name wildcards (\* and ?) when linking an FX to a preset (another way to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset)
- Added new source character "Toggle button" as a workaround for hardware buttons that can't be configured to act as momentary buttons (should usually be avoided; behavior is that it always sends 1 even when 0 is received)
- Improved understandability by renaming "Program" to "Bank" in conditional activation
- Fixed feedback issues due to numerical inaccuracies (especially useful for radio-button-like feedback from discrete target values)
- Fixed "FX chain chunk not found" error when on monitoring FX and "Auto-load preset" on
- Fixed sometimes missing feedback on target activation changes (e.g. when "Track must be selected" is used)

- Added ability that multiple instances work hand in hand when it comes to feedback (As long as 2 instances don't actively feedback to more than one control element at once, everything will be fine and should work just as with conditional activation within 1 instance.)
- Improved UI in minor ways
- Improved usability by respecting activation state of controller mappings with virtual targets when learning a main mapping source

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new track type "Dynamic" (allows to calculate a track number depending on ReaLearn's internal parameter values)
- Improved target track picker GUI by making it easier to create ReaLearn presets that are going to be used across different projects (e.g. "By name" now lets you enter a string as one would expect)
- Improved performance by trying to not send too much unnecessary feedback when mapping or mapping target activation states change
- Improved handling of REAPER's "Audio device closed" state (in ReaLearn < 2.5.0 being in that state for a long time could have led to slow memory exhaustion, in ReaLearn < 2.7.0 it would eventually lead to an error message "Full" instead - which is already better, and in 2.7.0 it's handled as it probably should)
- Fixed error message complaining about negative positions when using count-in and sometimes when playing from the very project start (introduced in 2.6.0)
- Improved usability by not intentionally generating a backtrace when pressing "Log debug info" (that caused confusion)
- Improved usability by reducing likelihood for audio dropouts by avoiding allocation in real-time thread when using very many mappings (probably premature optimization)
- Fixed another possible error message when closing a project while ReaLearn is open

- Added very flexible feedback-only "Raw MIDI" source in order to support feedback on controllers whose LEDs etc. can only be controlled via system-exclusive MIDI messages (e.g. Arturia MiniLab mkII)
- Added user guide entry and controller preset for Arturia MiniLab mkII (pad feedback now works thanks to ReaLearn's new sys-ex support!)
- Added user guide entry for OSC/PILOT
- Improved usability of min/max text fields on Windows and macOS by changing the value (and correcting the other value) not before leaving the field instead of immediately (the behavior before that was downright annoying as you can see here)
- Improved editing of advanced mapping settings by opening a dedicated small edit window with instant error checking (instead of just opening the system text editor, which sometimes doesn't work)
- Fixed possible "Full" error message when having projects with very many tracks
- Fixed possible error message with "Master tempo" target when mapping panel open

- Added option "Can deal with OSC bundles" to OSC device popup menu which can be unticked in order to achieve compatibility with devices not supporting them (e.g. Behringer mixers)
- Added user guide entries and controller presets for PreSonus FaderPort 8 and FaderPort Classic
- Improved reliability by avoiding memory exhaustion in the presence of potential programming errors (internally use bounded channels instead of unbounded one)
- Improved user guide and projection instructions by explaining how to open a context menu
- Fixed possible folder overflow with the "Exclusive: Within folder" setting introduced in the previous release
- Fixed non-occurring mapping row target label updates when track list changes

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added "Exclusive" dropdown to all "track property on/off"-style targets (arm, selection, mute, solo, fx all enable, automation touch state) which even allows "Exclusive within folder" behavior (my personal favorite)
- Added "Automation touch state" target in order to support "Touch" automation mode for volume, pan and width envelopes (e.g. with touch-sensitive faders or push encoders)
- Added option "Behavior" for "Track solo" target, start using the routing-friendly "Solo in front" behavior by default
- Added REAPER action "ReaLearn: Send feedback for all instances" (useful mainly for debugging purposes because ReaLearn usually sends feedback automatically)
- Improved "Track solo" target by making it work with "Options → Solo in front"
- Improved usability by clearing feedback (switch off lights or turn down motorized faders) when closing ReaLearn instance or REAPER project
- Improved "Track mute" target by making it work reliably also on master track and by making feedback from automation work
- Improved usability by disabling learning of "Track selection" target if REAPER preference "Mouse click on volume/pan faders and track buttons changes track selection" enabled (in order to avoid false positives, preference change respected after REAPER restart)
- Improved usability by making "Master tempo" target uneligible as "Last touched" target and for learning in general (there were too many false positives and it could get annoying at times, just select the target manually in the dropdown to use it)
- Improved usability by letting the user confirm before globally removing an OSC device
- Improved usability by not firing immediately when changing the encoder turning direction while using a negative "Speed" setting (that was annoying and could result in sudden unwanted parameter changes)
- Improved usability by not annoying user with error messages when controlling just because they use some setting that doesn't make sense (such as controlling relative targets with absolute messages)
- Improved usability by clearing feedback of the previous source if a mapping source is changed
- Fixed non-working automation writing for "Track width" target when controlled via relative encoder
- Fixed often missing initial feedback for virtual controller mappings (LEDs were sometimes not updated before interacting with the project, e.g. by pressing play)
- Fixed possible "assertion failed: 0.0 <= normalized\_value || normalized\_value.is\_nan()" error with volume targets
- Fixed recent bug that caused "Track selection" target to be learned with wrong track (the previously selected one instead of the newly selected)
- Fixed recent bug that caused wrong "Selected track" target feedback

            <version name="2.0.1" author="helgoboss" time="2021-02-10T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added a bunch of controller presets
- Added possibility to refer to a track via its name or position (as an alternative to the default of using its unique and stable ID) ← That's called track anchors, a powerful addition, if you ask me!
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "\<Focused>" (analogously to track "\<Selected>")
- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.20)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Added possibility to use preset "Reset to factory default" to clear all settings, groups and mappings (without changing the session ID)
- Added user guide sections "Tested controllers" and "Tutorials"
- Added experimental new option 'Make absolute' in order to convert relative to absolute values (lets you use EEL control transformation with encoders)
- Added powerful REAPER actions for learning and finding mappings without opening ReaLearn
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Improved usability by making most confirmation and alert dialogs modal with respect to the ReaLearn window itself, not REAPER
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Improved usability by including source character in mapping row source label (makes it easier to spot character guessing issues)
- Improved (N)RPN scanning to support popular controllers (such as Behringer BCR2000), prefer value-MSB-first now
- Improved user interface by making mapping rows less grey and adding some horizontal rules
- Improved usability by making "Absolute" the default invocation mode for actions, was "Trigger" before (this change could break some action mappings done with previous 1.12.0 prereleases)
- Improved "Length" sliders to work for "Incremental buttons" mode, too
- Improved usability by always sorting groups alphabetically
- Improved usage of ReaLearn as monitoring FX by making parameter feedback and learning work (usually, REAPER extensions don't get notified of anything happening on the monitoring FX chain, but at least for ReaLearn parameter changes I managed to create a workaround ... which is good news especially for global conditional activation use cases)
- Improved user guide (related to keyboard input, monitoring FX and limitations of monitoring FX)
- Improved safety by warning whenever loading something made in a newer ReaLearn version than the current one (version number gets part of the preset data, that also paves the way for preset migration)
- Improved usability by preferring position anchors over ID anchors when learning from a ReaLearn instance that is on the monitoring FX chain
- Improved wording related to encoders, renamed internal named parameter for setting state to 'set-state'
- Improved usability by making ID now really the new default FX anchor, not 'ID or position'
- Improved awareness by changing the prime EEL control transformation example into an actually very useful one: a curve
- Improved usability by indicating if MIDI input or output device disabled in REAPER preferences
- Improved behavior by disabling control (not just feedback) for disabled ReaLearn FX instances (before this, it still kept controlling when a device was selected as 'MIDI control input')
- Improved projection QR code detection rate by greatly simplifying it for now (doesn't carry certificate content anymore, which was only useful when using web-based companion app from mobile device, which is an edge case, especially considering that an iOS app is on the way)
- Improved usability by automatically switch off source/target filter learning when doing certain UI interactions
- Fixed nonsense learning of virtual sources in controller mappings compartment (that was really bad for batch learning control elements)
- Fixed missing mapping lanel UI update when learning other parameter of same FX
- Fixed 'Solo' target learning (was always resulting in master track)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn-monitoring-FX controlled targets to become sticky when switching between project tabs (not updating correctly)
- Fixed error message when pressing space bar in an empty ReaLearn instance
- Fixed possible "Raw pointer..." error when using track selection targets
- Fixed possible "couldn't get FX param value..." error when using FX parameter target
- Fixed action invocation mode "trigger", which sometimes wouldn't fire
- Fixed misleading labels in mapping panel
- Fixed feedback when reverse enabled and target range non-symmetric
- Fixed bug with broken plug-ins that report parameter as discrete but with a nonsensical step size of zero
- Fixed broken arrow symbols on Windows 7 (display rectangles instead of arrows)
- Fixed "Couldn't get preset count" error
- Fixed (N)RPN learning and consumption check
- Fixed wrong info that feedback not working for (N)RPN (it works!)
- Fixed "Track send pan" target (was confused with "Track send volume")
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action
- Fixed "is not a valid unit value" error (happened when reading volume values above the fader limit set in REAPER preferences)
- Fixed "negative MIDI frame offset" error (negative offsets are interpreted as zero now)
- Fixed "Message: assertion failed: Bpm::is\_valid(value)" error (could happen when using controllers that send MIDI clock)
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" error (caused by unexpected FX parameter change value)
- Fixed Windows 7 character issues in dropdown menus
- Fixed error message if track could not be found
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed
- Fixed auto correction for "Send feedback only if track armed"
- Fixed bug that could cause target value to get stuck if step size too small when it could be avoided
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error and potential race conditions when "Allow live FX multiprocessing" enabled
- Fixed segmentation fault on Linux when loading ReaLearn after plug-in scan
- Fixed wrong reverse behavior in 'Normal' mode when target value range is non-symmetric (old presets will keep their wrong behavior in order to not break existing projects)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.19+dev1226)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed possible crash when REAPER preference "Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins" is set (projection server now completely unloads and releases TCP ports when removing the last ReaLearn instance)
- Fixed serialization bug that caused source channel and number to be skipped from serialization and loaded as 0 instead of  (THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR 1.12 PRERELEASE PRESETS/PROJECTS, SORRY! When loading with pre9, check if there are any sources that unwillingly contains \<Any> as channel or number, manually change it to 0 and save the project/preset!)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed

The ones delivered by ReaPack should be moved automatically when doing a ReaPack sync.)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "\<Focused>" (analogously to track "\<Selected>")
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by prompting user for confirmation before switching from no preset to some preset if there are mappings defined already
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)

- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.

- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

- ReaLearn: #800 Added possibility to produce relative values in EEL control transformations
- ReaLearn: #1294 Added control transformation variable 'realearn\_last\_feedback\_value' (might be useful in mappings with virtual target, rarely needed, considered experimental, used in the new Console 1 MIDI relative preset)
- ReaLearn: #1290 Added possibility to pick among the actually available virtual control elements in the main mapping source section
- ReaLearn: #715 Added control transformation variable 'realearn\_timestamp', which is based on audio blocks and for MIDI even takes intra-block offset into account (it can't get more precise)
- ReaLearn: #1295 Added function 'realearn\_dbg' to EEL transformation (a debugging tool that prints floating-point values to stdout)
- ReaLearn: #1293 Improved preset picker by categorizing by device manufacturer
- ReaLearn: #1289 Improve feedback send behavior "Prevent echo feedback" by also making it work when used in a controller mapping (actually the most important place for using this option ... previously, it only worked when used in a main mapping)
- ReaLearn: Improve glue documentation by adding signal flow diagrams
- ReaLearn: Improved usability by clearing search field and filters when switching between compartments (this was confusing)
- ReaLearn: #1288 Fixed text entry in control transformation editor if a key is defined as global REAPER hotkey (most importantly, the SPACE key)
- ReaLearn: Fixed error when removing mapping while some mapping panel's edit control had focus

- ReaLearn: #1158 Added possibility to use keyboard input in addition to MIDI/OSC input (yes!)
- ReaLearn: #1155 Added menu entry "User interface => Background colors" to globally disable the use of background colors (useful when using custom Windows themes)

- ReaLearn: #1170 Fixed REAPER actions "ReaLearn: Find first mapping by source" (wouldn't find certain mappings) and "ReaLearn: Learn single mapping (reassigning source)" (always created new mappings)

- Playtime: #1163 Added track PDC information, including help texts (as a warning not to expect miracles when using high-latency FX)
- Playtime: #1168 Added support for REAPER's "Smooth seek": Clips will keep playing as if nothing happened. Current limitation: Smooth-seek to the left still leads to retriggering when using PDC.
- Playtime: #1119 Improved usability by always playing ignited clips when starting one specific clip when playback is stopped (makes users who come from other session views feel more at home)
- Playtime: #1146 Improved section and fade behavior and defaults in order to prevent unwanted auto-fades
- Playtime: #1132 Improved usability by making the static section an expert option and renaming it to "Source cut"
- Playtime: #1166 Improved usability by replacing the "Silence mode" design with a more traditional "Stopped" design (also, Playtime now starts by default in stopped state)
- Playtime: #1136 Improved keyboard control by handling SPACE even if set as a global shortcut in REAPER (needs REAPER 7.23+)
- Playtime: #1137 Improved usability by letting SPACE keep ongoing recordings instead of discarding them
- Playtime: #1164 Fixed clips completely losing sync when enabling or disabling high-latency FX due to PDC (for now only fixed when REAPER transport is stopped)
- Playtime: #1179 Fixed audio clips playing back slightly delayed right after recording (bug was introduced in 2.16.2)
- Playtime: #1143 Fixed Launchpad Pro detection on Windows if device name has a prefix (e.g. '2- ')
- Playtime: #1165 Fixed inability to use MIDI input devices with IDs > 63
- Playtime: #1149 Fixed App not getting keyboard focus unless clicking on specific areas such as the matrix view (keyboard shortcuts now work immediately after opening the app)
- Playtime: #1160 Fixed play cursors in MIDI editor and waveform view noticeably off when using high-latency FX (due to PDC)
- Playtime: #1156 Fixed audio clips turning silent when starting REAPER playback and having high-latency FX in the signal flow (due to PDC)
- Playtime: #1135 Fixed tempo detection recordings not working via controller

            <version name="2.16.0" author="helgoboss" time="2024-07-07T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- General: Important rebranding: The plug-in has been renamed from "ReaLearn" to "Helgobox - ReaLearn & Playtime". Helgobox unites 2 products: ReaLearn (free and open-source) and Playtime (paid and mostly closed-source).
- General: The plug-in now requires at least REAPER 6.11 (I simplified some code by using REAPER 6.11 features)
- General: Changed scripting language from Lua 5.4 to Luau (existing scripts should run in the same way as before because all Lua 5.4 functions that I have previously unlocked for usage are also available in Luau)
- General: Internal change: Renamed lots of Prometheus metrics
- General: Internal change: Enforced UTF-8-encoded paths very early in the processing when interfacing with the REAPER API (REAPER by contract should provide UTF-8 encoded paths, if not it's a bug in REAPER)
- General: Internal change: Use Rust 1.79.0
- General: Added welcome screen which allows one to add a Playtime toolbar button. That works best with current REAPER releases, older REAPER versions require a restart.
- General: Added Helgobox App: An app that provides the user interface for Playtime and ReaLearn Projection. Right now, it is only available embedded into REAPER and only on macOS on Windows. In the future, it will be made available for Linux, Android and iOS, eventually replacing the ReaLearn Companion App.
- General: #906 Added a REAPER extension, which is automatically loaded at REAPER startup and acts as a supplement to the actual VST plug-in. Provides a convenient entry 'Helgobox' in the REAPER 'Extensions' menu and other features right after REAPER start, which would otherwise only be available if at least one ReaLearn VST plug-in instance is loaded. This extension is currently shipped on Windows and macOS. It's optional, ReaLearn will also work without it!
- General: #908 Added extensive auto-generated Luau type definitions for building ReaLearn presets, ReaLearn MIDI script sources and Playtime matrices with auto-completion and error reporting (for code editors with Luau support, e.g. Visual Studio Code)
- General: Internal change: Added counter of undesired real-time allocations to UI (debug builds only)
- General: Improved import by warning when invalid top-level properties were detected (which could indicate wrong usage of the import API)
- General: Improved error reporting when importing invalid Luau code by making the error cause more visible
- General: Improved reliability of preset loading/import in high-CPU usage situations by increasing the maximum execution time of Luau scripts
- General: Improved reporting of general errors by not just logging repeated error messages as vertical dashes (this was confusing)
- General: Improved Lua-based presets and imports by detecting cyclic module dependencies
- General: #913 Improved general performance by introducing lots of small-scale boosts after profiling hot code (non-crypto hash functions, unnecessary allocation and processing)
- General: #915 Improved robustness and usability by not participating in REAPER's undo anymore (this can prevent potentially fatal but in any case surprising scenarios in which doing an undo in REAPER sets back ReaLearn and Playtime to a very old state, requires REAPER >= v7.09+dev0202)
- General: Improved resource usage (by firing up threads for async logging and metrics only if enabled, by letting ReaLearn and Clip Engine metrics share the same thread, by  making app and server share the same one-threaded async runtime and by stopping async deallocation thread and async runtime when last ReaLearn instance gone)
- General: Improved plug-in scanning speed (Helgobox won't initialize a few things if it knows it's just being scanned anyway)
- General: Improved resource clean-up on Windows when REAPER preference "Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins" enabled
- General: Fixed some incorrect detection of recursive tables in Luau code on import
- General: #875 Fixed deadlock when using 500+ Helgobox instances
- General: Fixed potential hard crash in process\_f64 call
- General: Fixed possible panic when closing REAPER
- General: #916 Fixed scaling issue on Linux (colors are now also available on Linux but still looks a bit funny, hopefully the dark mode detection for SWELL customizations works now)
- General: Internal change: Removed old logging framework
- ReaLearn: Added generic main preset for changing FX parameters
- ReaLearn: #870 Added ability to add additional units to one ReaLearn instance (= one ReaLearn instance can now deal with multiple controllers)
- ReaLearn: #901 Added support for compartment presets written in the Luau language (including the ability to require other Luau modules in the same namespace)
- ReaLearn: #908 Added menu option to create a ready-made preset development workspace that can be opened in Visual Studio Code (see workspace README for details)
- ReaLearn: Added possibility to reuse Luau code defined once within a compartment preset across all MIDI script sources used in that compartment (avoids having to duplicate device-specific code in hundreds of mapping, saving memory ... and it just makes sense)
- ReaLearn: #902 Added support for factory presets (they are really built-in, not shipped separately ... presets currently distributed via ReaPack will disappear soon)
- ReaLearn: #903 Added feedback logging to mapping panels (analogously to control logging)
- ReaLearn: #900 Added "Auto units" feature (1. Globally define what controllers you have => 2. Choose which main preset you want to use for which controller => 3. Make one or several ReaLearn instances automatically load/unload those presets whenever the controllers are connected/disconnected ... controller manager is a part of the Helgobox App, which is currently only available to Playtime Early Access testers)
- ReaLearn: #905 Added possibility to add metadata to Luau presets (displayed in the upcoming Helgobox App and used for the new "Auto units" feature as well as automatic creation of known controllers
- ReaLearn: #905 Added auto-magical creation of known MIDI controllers (via MIDI device inquiry, used for the new "Auto units" features)
- ReaLearn: #757 Added possibility to write feedback scripts in the glue section: Now you can build arbitrary feedback messages using Lua code (custom text formatting is just one of the many possibilities).
- ReaLearn: #716 Added experimental Novation SL MkIII Pot Browser Control preset (available here)
- ReaLearn: #716 Added text placeholders "target.available", "global.realearn\_time", "target.discrete\_value" and "target.discrete\_value\_count"
- ReaLearn: #743 Added text placeholders "target.fx\_parameter.macro.new\_section.name" and "target.fx\_parameter.macro.section.index" to target "FX parameter: Set value"
- ReaLearn: #743 Added many text placeholders to targets "Pot: Browse presets" and "Pot: Load preset" for obtaining preset metadata such as author and comment
- ReaLearn: Improved virtual control by considering two same-named virtual control elements with different character the same (this change has only been made to named control elements, not to numbered ones!)
- ReaLearn: #923 Improved auto-load by falling back to initially active preset when no FX focused
- ReaLearn: #928 Improved both "After timeout" fire modes by respecting button filter setting (this makes long-press-on-release-off scenarios achievable with just one mapping)
- ReaLearn: Improved Projection feature by building it into the Helgobox App (which is only accessible to early-access Playtime testers at the moment)
- ReaLearn: Improved Midi Fighter Twister controller presets: Now Lua-based, with ReaLearn color support and available in 2 different virtual control schemes (grid and numbered)
- ReaLearn: Improved ReaLearn REAPER actions by showing an error if instance needed to execute the action and improving macOS message panel font size
- ReaLearn: Improved Lua MIDI scripts by allowing them to access the common compartment Lua module even when just calculating the feedback address
- ReaLearn: #904 Improved target menu by distinguishing between different target sections
- ReaLearn: #902 Improved preset sharing by introducing the concept of preset namespaces (each sub folder of the main/controller preset folder is now a namespace, that means it's completely self-contained and can be easily shared, each namespace shows up in a different sub menu when browsing presets)
- ReaLearn: #788 Improved shutdown behavior by switching all device LEDs/screens off and tearing all motor faders down when quitting REAPER
- ReaLearn: #914 Improved input/output pickers by distinguishing between available and not available devices
- ReaLearn: #913 Improved OSC performance by processing more OSC messages per cycle
- ReaLearn: Improved dummy target by making it work just like most other targets (generating pseudo feedback, value changes observable in mapping panel etc.)
- ReaLearn: #916 Improved user interface by adding colors
- ReaLearn: #864 Improved feedback due to conditional activation/deactivation by emitting it in deterministic order (in mapping order)
- ReaLearn: #716 Improved feedback possibilities by processing text feedback expressions and scripts even if target doesn't support normal (numerical) feedback
- ReaLearn: Fixed memorization of last color in color picker
- ReaLearn: #862 Fixed source "MIDI script" feedback address not being respected (important e.g. for switching feedback off correctly)
- ReaLearn: #863 Fixed ambiguous "kind" properties in ReaLearn Script (Lua import/export)
- ReaLearn: #716 Fixed "context.feedback\_value.color" not containing nil when no color set in source "MIDI script"
- ReaLearn: #860 Fixed possible freeze when using "Open in text editor on macOS" by completely disabling this function on macOS
- ReaLearn: #857 Fixed possible error when using "Selected" track selector and removing that selected track
- ReaLearn: #867 Fixed possible 'REAPER string should be UTF-8 encoded' error (when using long compartment parameter names in ReaLearn and referring to them elsewhere, e.g. as TCP param)
- ReaLearn: #865 Fixed Lua import of XTouchMackieLCD display source settings
- ReaLearn: #866 Fixed linking from FX to preset when ReaLearn is on monitoring FX chain
- ReaLearn: Fixed 'BorrowMut' error when copy/pasting mapping with target-based activation condition
- ReaLearn: Internal change: Removed undocumented ReaLearn script utility functions
- ReaLearn: Removed CSI MST import
- Playtime: Added Playtime as beta
- SoundPot: #931 Added recording of preset previews for exporting purposes
- SoundPot: #861 Improved usability by stopping preview as soon as loading the preset
- SoundPot: #743 Improved target "Pot: Preview preset" by using the same sound player as the Pot Browser (inherits its functionality such as customizable volume and stopping playback when preset loaded)
- SoundPot: #716 Improved availability check for almost all Pot targets (good for advanced visual feedback of what Pot features are available in a certain situation, see new text placeholder "target.available")

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Playtime-related changes (details available for early-access testers only)
- Improved virtual control by considering two same-named virtual control elements with different character the same (this change has only been made to named control elements, not to numbered ones!)
- Improved auto-load by falling back to initially active preset when no FX focused
- Improved both "After timeout" fire modes by respecting button filter setting (this makes long-press-on-release-off scenarios achievable with just one mapping)
- Improved "suitable main preset selection" algorithm when connecting known controllers
- Improved import by warning when invalid top-level properties were detected (which could indicate wrong usage of the import API)
- Improved error reporting when importing invalid Luau code by making the error cause more visible
- Improved reliability of preset loading/import in high-CPU usage situations by increasing the maximum execution time of Luau scripts
- Improved reporting of general errors by not just logging repeated error messages as vertical dashes (this was confusing)
- Fixed memorization of last color in color picker
- Fixed broken connection from ReaLearn Companion running on Android
- Fixed possible errors when connecting MIDI devices (related to the new controller auto detection)
- Fixed some incorrect detection of recursive tables in Luau code on import
- Removed CSI MST import
- Internal change: Removed undocumented ReaLearn script utility functions
- Internal change: Removed old logging framework
- Internal change: Renamed lots of Prometheus metrics
- Internal change: Enforced UTF-8-encoded paths very early in the processing when interfacing with the REAPER API (REAPER by contract should provide UTF-8 encoded paths, if not it's a bug in REAPER)

            <version name="2.16.0-pre.9" author="helgoboss" time="2024-02-08T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Playtime-related changes (details available for early-access testers only)
- Changed scripting language from Lua 5.4 to Luau (existing scripts should run in the same way as before because all Lua 5.4 functions that I have previously unlocked for usage are also available in Luau)
- First mention of the upcoming product name "Helgobox": The VST plug-in that we know as ReaLearn will soon be renamed to "Helgobox". ReaLearn will stay as the central part of Helgobox. The other parts will be "Playtime" and (in long-term future) "Sound Pot". In a nutshell: Helgobox = ReaLearn + Playtime + SoundPot = A collection of creative tools that turns REAPER into a powerful musical instrument ... you will see the big picture as soon as Playtime 2 is revealed.
- Added new REAPER extension called "Helgobox", which is automatically loaded at REAPER startup and acts as a supplement to the actual VST plug-in. Provides a convenient top-level menu and other features right after start, which would otherwise only be available if at least one ReaLearn VST plug-in instance is loaded. This extension is currently shipped on Windows and macOS but in general it's optional, ReaLearn will also work without it!
- Added ability to add additional units to one ReaLearn instance (= one ReaLearn instance can now deal with multiple controllers)
- Added support for compartment presets written in the Luau language (including the ability to require other Luau modules in the same namespace)
- Added extensive auto-generated Luau type definitions for building ReaLearn presets, ReaLearn MIDI script sources and Playtime matrices with auto-completion and error reporting (for code editors with Luau support, e.g. Visual Studio Code)
- Added menu option to create a ready-made preset development workspace that can be opened in Visual Studio Code (see workspace README for details)
- Added possibility to reuse Luau code defined once within a compartment preset across all MIDI script sources used in that compartment (avoids having to duplicate device-specific code in hundreds of mapping, saving memory ... and it just makes sense)
- Added support for factory presets (they are really built-in, not shipped separately ... presets currently distributed via ReaPack will disappear soon)
- Added feedback logging to mapping panels (analogously to control logging)
- Added "Auto units" feature (1. Globally define what controllers you have => 2. Choose which main preset you want to use for which controller => 3. Make one or several ReaLearn instances automatically load/unload those presets whenever the controllers are connected/disconnected ... controller manager is a part of the Helgobox App, which is currently only available to Playtime Early Access testers)
- Added possibility to add metadata to Luau presets (displayed in the upcoming Helgobox App and used for the new "Auto units" feature as well as automatic creation of known controllers
- Added auto-magical creation of known MIDI controllers (via MIDI device inquiry, used for the new "Auto units" features)
- Improved target menu by distinguishing between different target sections
- Improved preset sharing by introducing the concept of preset namespaces (each sub folder of the main/controller preset folder is now a namespace, that means it's completely self-contained and can be easily shared, each namespace shows up in a different sub menu when browsing presets)
- Improved shutdown behavior by switching all device LEDs/screens off and tearing all motor faders down when quitting REAPER
- Improved input/output pickers by distinguishing between available and not available devices
- Improved OSC performance by processing more OSC messages per cycle
- Improved general performance by introducing lots of small-scale boosts after profiling hot code (non-crypto hash functions, unnecessary allocation and processing)
- Improved robustness and usability by not participating in REAPER's undo anymore (this can prevent potentially fatal but in any case surprising scenarios in which doing an undo in REAPER sets back ReaLearn and Playtime to a very old state, requires REAPER >= v7.09+dev0202)
- Improved dummy target by making it work just like most other targets (generating pseudo feedback, value changes observable in mapping panel etc.)
- Improved user interface by adding colors
- Fixed scaling issue on Linux (colors are now also available on Linux but still looks a bit funny, hopefully the dark mode detection for SWELL customizations works now)
- Internal change: Use Rust 1.75.0

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Pot Browser: Added support for "Project databases" (add via '+' icon, gives you essentially a history of sounds/presets used in all of your projects)
- Pot Browser: Added new text feedback placeholders "fx\_parameter.macro.section.name" and "fx\_parameter.macro.name"
- Pot Browser: Added preset context menu action "Reveal preview in file manager"
- Pot Browser: Added preset metadata section containing information about author, vendor, file size and modification date (if available)
- Pot Browser: Added more options to configure when to display FX windows and when to hide them
- Pot Browser: Added preset context menu action "Pre-play" (This is fun! It's like a preview on steroids. Pot Browser will load the preview into RS5k sampler, making it playable on your keyboard. So you can play the sound in a lower quality without actually loading the preset. Useful if loading a preset is slow and you want to get a first impression before loading it. Or use it in creative ways!)
- Pot Browser: Improved UI a bit (show notifications a bit longer, better text formatting and error messages, better responsiveness, avoid empty "round dot" context menu)
- Pot Browser: Fixed VST2 plug-ins with negative magic number not showing up (e.g. "Op-X Pro II")
- Pot Browser: Fixed some Komplete banks and categories not showing up (e.g. "MiniMonsta 2"
- Pot Browser: Fixed NKS macro parameters for all VST3 plug-ins not being found
- Pot Browser: Fixed internal "FX presets" for all VST2 plug-ins not showing up
- Pot Browser: Fixed JSFX effects failing to load if they have a file extension (e.g. Saike's JSFX)
- Pot Browser: Fixed possible crash by preventing Pot Browser from replacing its associated ReaLearn instance

            <version name="2.14.0" author="helgoboss" time="2022-11-24T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new MIDI source "Specific program change" (which makes it more straightforward to react to specific programs)
- Added dynamic track expression variables "instance\_track\_tcp\_index" and "instance\_track\_mcp\_index"
- Added menu and help buttons to the header panel
- Added previous/next buttons to the mapping panel (for navigating in the list of mappings that's currently visible in the main panel)
- Added more comfortable editing for OSC feedback arguments and help button
- Added Lua snippet versioning (from now on, all Lua exports from ReaLearn will contain the ReaLearn version number; used for getting version conflict warnings on import and applying migration logic; in your own Lua code, you should make sure it's set from now on ... removing it will make ReaLearn think that it's an old preset and then it might apply some migration logic that you don't want)
- Added new takeover mode "Pickup (tolerant)" (prevents jumps but also makes extra sure the target doesn't get stuck, in addition to below mdmayfield improvements)
- Added new text feedback placeholder "target.width.mcu" to target "Track: Set stereo width" for pretty display of width value
- Added new experimental "Pot" targets for preset browsing in a large pot of presets (first supported preset database: Komplete NKS, see dedicated REAPER forum thread for details)
- Added new feedback-only source "Speech" for speaking out numeric or text feedback via Windows/macOS built-in text-to-speech engine (no Linux yet, sorry)
- Added new track selectors that respect track visibility in TCP or MCP
- Added new dynamic track variables "selected\_track\_tcp\_index" and "selected\_track\_mcp\_index"
- Added new options to target "Project: Navigate within tracks" to respect visibility in TCP or MCP
- Added fancy control transformation editor with visual preview of curve/transition (Windows/macOS only for now)
- Added control transformation template facility (including some first templates, hard-coded, Windows/macOS only for now)
- Added option to respect/ignore track grouping to supported track targets
- Added option to enable/disable selection ganging to supported track targets
- Added target control information to mapping panel (Very useful to understand what's going on! For real-time-MIDI-controlled mappings, this only works if target control logging is enabled.)
- Added new target "Global: Mouse" to control the mouse (one use case is to control the FX parameter which is currently under the mouse cursor)
- Added possibility to save compartment notes (they are also saved with compartment presets)
- Added multi-line editing and error reporting for EEL transformation formulas
- Added possibility to force or prevent smooth seek in seek and marker/region targets
- Added display type "Studiologic SL Keyboard display" for showing arbitrary text on the keyboard (tested with SL88)
- Added display types "X-Touch Mackie LCD" and "X-Touch Mackie LCD XT" for enabling LCD color support when certain X-Touch devices are in MCU mode
- Added various options to decide whether to keep ReaLearn active if its project tab is in the background (accessible via right-click menu)
- Added option to play sound when target has been invoked successfully ("Beep on success" checkbox at the bottom left of the mapping panel, great for trigger-like targets such as saving a snapshot)
- Added target "Track: Enable/disable parent send" (great for MIDI routing in the context of song switching)
- Added option to prevent resetting feedback when releasing sources (accessible via right-click menu, good for using REAPER/ReaLearn as a remote control for hardware devices)
- Added stop function to be used in control transformation formulas to emit a target value and stop the currently running transition at once
- Added context menu entry "Open preset folder"
- Added "Retrigger" option to target "FX parameter: Set value" (sets parameter even if it already has desired value)
- Improved usability by allowing raw MIDI pattern (e.g. sysex) to be edited in separate editor window which also indicates whether the pattern is valid (both in source and target)
- Improved takeover modes substantially by applying the "mdmayfield improvements": No more backwards jumps! Much less getting-stuck situations! Ability to choose a fixed default for jump max! (Thanks a lot to mdmayfield who made the initial contribution!)
- Improved usability by removing "Jump min/max" settings and introducing an "Off" mode instead (the value for jump max is now an implementation detail; custom min/max values are still supported but only for old presets to ensure backward compatibility; one can use a value sequence as alternative to jump min)
- Improved auto-load mode by automagically falling back to memorized mappings when FX loses focus (users will love this because it's much more intuitive than "Make instance superior", which still has its uses though in more complex scenarios where you want multiple instances)
- Improved wording by consistently using "Browse ..." instead of "Navigate within ..." or "Cycle through ..."
- Improved wording by using less technical object selector names (e.g. "Particular" instead of "By ID")
- Improved usability by displaying in status bar if control/feedback globally off (don't show by greying out mapping rows anymore)
- Improved usability by insisting on keyboard focus, even if 'Send all keyboard focus to plug-in' is disabled
- Improved target-based conditional activation by listening to target activation/deactivation as well
- Improved usability by marking targets that support MIDI real-time control (because MIDI real-time control has a few restrictions)
- Improved source "MIDI script" when used with Lua language by making color information available (allows users to provide support for arbitrary MIDI color LEDs/displays, in addition to the built-in ones)
- Improved target logging by including target control errors and other information
- Improved usability by making it possible to copy and paste the activation condition of a mapping
- Improved preset loading by supporting placing preset files in sub directories (1 level, ATTENTION: The parent directory will become part of the preset ID, so don't move existing presets!)
- Improved preset loading by supporting symlinked preset files
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by respecting the "Reverse" checkbox when loading the default value (great for changing the perspective when it comes to on/off targets)
- Improved usability of the snapshot targets by displaying the snapshot ID in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by displaying the parameter index in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by making the parameter learnable
- Improved usability by making text feedback available with dummy target (great for sending just some constant text or using placeholders that don't need target context)
- Improved usability by displaying session ID in the status bar (should help detecting duplicate IDs, which can be useful e.g. when using projection)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by enabling feedback (showing if the desired snapshot is currently loaded or not)
- Improved versatility of target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" by making trigger-like actions controllable by relative endless encoders (via invocation mode "Trigger")
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot" by adding the "Last loaded" selector (great for assigning a particular button to update the currently loaded snapshot)
- Fixed missing feedback of "FX: Enable/disable" target when Bypass parameter is automated
- Fixed FX still being considered as focused when focus is changed from the FX window to the main area
- Fixed track peak target not respecting solo state of other tracks
- Fixed action target invocation mode 7-bit/14-bit confusion (existing presets will automatically be migrated, so existing behavior will not change)
- Fixed failed scan on macOS El Capitan (ReaLearn stopped working on it since v2.13, fixed by removing Prometheus metrics support for macOS Intel builds)
- Fixed unreliable refresh of dynamic track result UI refresh in target section of mapping panel
- Fixed various mapping panel GUI bugs
- Fixed missing feedback refresh when dealing with multiple instances (e.g. via "Make instance superior")
- Fixed missing automatic feedback for target "FX: Set online/offline"
- Fixed unreliable track visibility change detection
- Fixed rel\_time transformations to respect reverse, target min/max/sequence and rounding (also hide some settings that don't make sense)
- Fixed OSC compatibility with certain apps such as Syntien (control didn't work when both control and feedback were enabled for the device)
- Fixed target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" invocation mode "Trigger" (could potentially suffer from not being retriggered in some situations)
- Fixed bug that caused retriggerable targets to not be retriggered with relative control if they already had the desired value
- Fixed error when learning/using special keys on macOS (keyboard source)
- Fixed REAPER track color detection
- Fixed bug that caused parameters and custom projection data to not be cleared when switching preset to None
- Fixed fire modes when using rel\_time transitions
- Fixed saving of snapshot IDs in target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Fixed feedback of target "Marker/region: Go to" (it was changing even when playback was stopped)
- Fixed ReaLearn still being active when disabling it via its automatable "Bypass" parameter (as opposed to disabling it via checkbox or ReaScript)
- Fixed deletion of mapping snapshots when copying and pasting a compartment
- Fixed "mapping not found" error when removing a mapping while still learning it
- Fixed infinite error loop and certain "track is not available"-like errors
- Fixed change detection for FX on the monitoring FX chain (most importantly enable/disable, in general ReaLearn should now work much better when targeting monitoring FX and also work better if it's placed on the monitoring FX chain itself)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added menu and help buttons to the header panel
- Added previous/next buttons to the mapping panel (for navigating in the list of mappings that's currently visible in the main panel)
- Added more comfortable editing for OSC feedback arguments and help button
- Added Lua snippet versioning (from now on, all Lua exports from ReaLearn will contain the ReaLearn version number; used for getting version conflict warnings on import and applying migration logic; in your own Lua code, you should make sure it's set from now on ... removing it will make ReaLearn think that it's an old preset and then it might apply some migration logic that you don't want)
- Added new takeover mode "Pickup (tolerant)" (prevents jumps but also makes extra sure the target doesn't get stuck, in addition to below mdmayfield improvements)
- Added new text feedback placeholder "target.width.mcu" to target "Track: Set stereo width" for pretty display of width value
- Improved takeover modes substantially by applying the "mdmayfield improvements": No more backwards jumps! Much less getting-stuck situations! Ability to choose a fixed default for jump max! (Thanks a lot to mdmayfield who made the initial contribution!)
- Improved usability by removing "Jump min/max" settings and introducing an "Off" mode instead (the value for jump max is now an implementation detail; custom min/max values are still supported but only for old presets to ensure backward compatibility; one can use a value sequence as alternative to jump min)
- Improved auto-load mode by automagically falling back to memorized mappings when FX loses focus (users will love this because it's much more intuitive than "Make instance superior", which still has its uses though in more complex scenarios where you want multiple instances)
- Improved selection ganging and grouping support for track targets by lifting the last remaining limitations (e.g. that it was not possible for phase/invert or that sometimes only both are supported at the same time ... needs REAPER 6.69+dev1102)
- Fixed buggy dynamic track expression variables selected\_track\_tcp\_index and selected\_track\_mcp\_index
- Fixed incorrect mapping row labels for new track selectors
- Fixed missing feedback refresh when dealing with multiple instances (e.g. via "Make instance superior")
- Fixed missing automatic feedback for target "FX: Set online/offline"
- Fixed FX enable/disable target learning, it was picking it up as Bypass parameter (pre-release regression)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Internal change: Migrated to Rust 1.63.0
- Added display type "Studiologic SL Keyboard display" for showing arbitrary text on the keyboard (tested with SL88)
- Added display types "X-Touch Mackie LCD" and "X-Touch Mackie LCD XT" for enabling LCD color support when certain X-Touch devices are in MCU mode
- Added various options to decide whether to keep ReaLearn active if its project tab is in the background (accessible via right-click menu)
- Added option to play sound when target has been invoked successfully ("Beep on success" checkbox at the bottom left of the mapping panel, great for trigger-like targets such as saving a snapshot)
- Added target "Track: Enable/disable parent send" (great for MIDI routing in the context of song switching)
- Added option to prevent resetting feedback when releasing sources (accessible via right-click menu, good for using REAPER/ReaLearn as a remote control for hardware devices)
- Added stop function to be used in control transformation formulas to emit a target value and stop the currently running transition at once
- Added context menu entry "Open preset folder"
- Added "Retrigger" option to target "FX parameter: Set value" (sets parameter even if it already has desired value)
- Improved preset loading by supporting placing preset files in sub directories (1 level, ATTENTION: The parent directory will become part of the preset ID, so don't move existing presets!)
- Improved preset loading by supporting symlinked preset files
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by respecting the "Reverse" checkbox when loading the default value (great for changing the perspective when it comes to on/off targets)
- Improved usability of the snapshot targets by displaying the snapshot ID in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by displaying the parameter index in the row label
- Improved usability of source "ReaLearn parameter" by making the parameter learnable
- Improved usability by making text feedback available with dummy target (great for sending just some constant text or using placeholders that don't need target context)
- Improved usability by displaying session ID in the status bar (should help detecting duplicate IDs, which can be useful e.g. when using projection)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by enabling feedback (showing if the desired snapshot is currently loaded or not)
- Improved versatility of target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" by making trigger-like actions controllable by relative endless encoders (via invocation mode "Trigger")
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot" by adding the "Last loaded" selector (great for assigning a particular button to update the currently loaded snapshot)
- Fixed saving of snapshot IDs in target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Fixed feedback of target "Marker/region: Go to" (it was changing even when playback was stopped)
- Fixed ReaLearn still being active when disabling it via its automatable "Bypass" parameter (as opposed to disabling it via checkbox or ReaScript)
- Fixed deletion of mapping snapshots when copying and pasting a compartment
- Fixed "mapping not found" error when removing a mapping while still learning it
- Fixed infinite error loop and certain "track is not available"-like errors
- Fixed change detection for FX on the monitoring FX chain (most importantly enable/disable, in general ReaLearn should now work much better when targeting monitoring FX and also work better if it's placed on the monitoring FX chain itself)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Internal change: Migrate to Rust 1.61
- Added target-based conditional activation
- Added target "ReaLearn: Take mapping snapshot"
- Added "Keyboard" source
- Added new "Instance track" concept, a corresponding track selector \<Instance> and a way to set the instance track (this enables many new scenarios such as track pinning)
- Added new "Instance FX" concept, a corresponding FX selector \<Instance> and a way to set the instance FX (this enables many new scenarios such as FX pinning)
- Added absolute mode "Make relative" for turning absolute fader/knob movements into relative target adjustments
- Added absolute mode "Performance control" for emulating the behavior of a typical soft synth modulation matrix mapping
- Added source "Timer" for repeated triggering of arbitrary targets (you can find it in source category "REAPER", can for example be used to repeatedly send a particular OSC message, which is a precondition to support Behringer X32 OSC)
- Added new source "ReaLearn parameter" in source category "REAPER" (for controlling targets with ReaLearn's automatable parameters itself)
- Added initial accessibility (Thanks a lot to AZSlow3 for his contribution!)
- Added possibility to address an FX instance relative to the current ReaLearn instance by using dynamic FX expression variable this\_fx\_index
- Added instance\_track\_index and instance\_fx\_index variables to dynamic expressions (allows us cycling through tracks/FX while pinning them as instance track/FX)
- Added "FX" target (analogously to "Track" target, well-suited for text feedback concerning a particular FX)
- Added possibility to modulate ReaLearn target values and smooth transitions by making the rel\_time variable available in control transformation formulas (read more on the issue tracker or in the user guide)
- Added "ReaLearn: Dummy" target
- Added support for Mackie Extender (XT) displays
- Added option to log target control values (available in header panel context menu)
- Added possibility to target FX parameters shown in track control panel by using the new variables tcp\_fx\_indexes and tcp\_fx\_parameter\_indexes in dynamic FX and FX parameter expressions
- Added context menu action "Dry-run Lua script from clipboard"
- Added support for importing JSON presets via "Import from clipboard"
- Added possibility to write MIDI scripts in Lua
- Added possibility to map text feedback to numeric source values (API-only, feedback\_value\_table)
- Added new activation condition type "Expression" (which lets one use the same expression language in activation conditions that's also used for dynamic selectors)
- Added comprehensive support for discrete ReaLearn parameters (now you can use integers instead of only floating pointer numbers between 0.0 and 1.0)
- Added target "FX parameter: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Send: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Track: Set monitoring mode"
- Added support for instance-specific "FX-to-preset links" (making it possible to distinguish between different controllers when using "Auto-load: Depending on focused FX")
- Added support for OSC value ranges other than 0.0 to 1.0
- Added support for OSC type tags Int and Long
- Added new context menu action "Named listed mappings after source"
- Added limited support for offline rendering (works now with REAPER >= v6.52+dev0323, limited to controlling FX parameters on the same track)
- Added option in context menu to log not just real but also incoming/outgoing virtual control elements and values (very useful for debugging mappings)
- Added invocation mode "Absolute (7-bit)" to target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" (for controlling actions that don't correctly interpret 14-bit values, e.g. "SWS/SM: Live Config #1 - Apply config (MIDI/OSC only)")
- Added plug'n'play for MIDI devices, also on Windows (automatically resends all feedback shortly after MIDI device plugged in without further user interaction)
- Added John's presets for Behringer MOTÖR and FCB1010
- Added clip engine to be used by upcoming Playtime 2
- Improved target "MIDI: Send message" by lifting all previous restrictions when using destination "FX output" (Yes, you can now play your VSTs via OSC!)
- Improved precision for entering and displaying percentages and dB to 4 fractional digits (e.g. useful for values in value sequences)
- Improved error reporting by including the name of the channel in case a channel ran full
- Improved ReaLearn plug-in topology by removing output pins (since ReaLearn doesn't output any audio streams)
- Improved keyboard source significantly (save/load, more reliable key catching, catching of modifier-only key presses, keystroke normalization for better cross-platform experience, portability warnings)
- Improved selectors "All by name" and "All selected" by allowing combinatorial explosion (you can now easily target many FX, FX parameters and sends on many tracks with just one target ... powerful, use with caution!)
- Improved OSC by using one socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (makes "respond to sender" possible, used for example by Behringer XR mixers)
- Improved user interface on macOS by taking up less vertical screen space (and a tiny bit less horizontal one, too)
- Improved (or made worse?) user interface for macOS light mode by using an ugly but at least bright scrollbar
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by making the number of banks configurable (by entering a value count for the corresponding ReaLearn parameter)
- Improved performance when automating ReaLearn parameters by not processing value updates if value didn't change
- Improved user interface layout for OSC source and target "OSC: Send message"
- Improved dropdown menu for choosing an absolute mode by adding "NOT APPLICABLE" if the mode doesn't make sense under the current conditions
- Temporarily switched of auto-correction of absolute modes to see if users miss it or we can just throw it out
- Improved usability by reducing height of mapping panel on Windows and macOS (also vastly improved GUI dialog development tooling to gain more flexibility for GUI modifications)
- Improved wording of log actions and log messages
- Improved usability by using text field to enter marker/region position
- Improved accuracy when using relative mode with continuous target by not exceeding target min/max
- Improved "Auto-load preset" feature to be more generic. It now works on the current instance FX instead of just on the currently focused FX (allows much more flexible auto-loading)
- Improved usability by making trigger-like targets controllable with encoders (by default, each encoder increment/decrement will trigger the target)
- Improved virtual source label in mapping row
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" to be able to load manually taken mapping snapshots and set default values
- Improved error reporting if session could not be restored (now logs session JSON)
- Improved usability by making None the default source and dummy target the default target
- Improved GUI dimensions on Linux, Windows and macOS
- Improved virtual feedback message logging by logging them even if no match found
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by showing value labels of discrete parameters as bank names
- Improved projection by making it possible to use without saving a controller preset (projection widget settings are now saved together with the ReaLearn instance)
- Improved UI by adding link to list of tested controllers in help menu
- Improved UI by refreshing input/output dropdowns on MIDI device changes
- Fixed backward compatibility to some old presets that use JSON null instead of omitting properties
- Fixed learning/filtering for Arturia encoders in relative mode
- Fixed accumulated control and possible errors after rendering
- Fixed cut-off MIDI device names
- Fixed error 'Only one of step\_size\_interval and step\_factor\_interval can be set' on Lua import
- Fixed "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" for default group
- Fixed long-standing serious GUI lags when modifying multiple tracks at once
- Fixed target incorrect track peaks when using "Track: Peak" target with multi-channel tracks (Thanks a lot to AlbertoV5's contribution!)
- Fixed missing update when changing FX in FX-related targets
- Fixed missing text feedback updates when using placeholder target.fx.name and target.fx.index
- Fixed "channel full" messages on high load (e.g. selecting many tracks at once) and improved initial memory consumption
- Fixed error when using plug-ins with non-UTF8 names
- Fixed feedback for virtual controller mappings by sending "Off" when not in use
- Fixed feedback for virtual controller mappings if they are inactive
- Fixed missing feedback on activation changes when replacing all parameters
- Fixed bug that caused enabling/disabling ReaLearn to have no effect when on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed white background color when using dark SWELL settings on Linux (by not enforcing any background color at all)
- Fixed bug in target "MIDI: Send message" that made repeated sending of the same value have no effect with some configurations
- Fixed sometimes missing text feedback updates for clip seek target and some other targets
- Fixed some potential errors when using "Copy as Lua"
- Fixed bug when combining conditional activation with single press fire mode (modifier firing unexpectedly)
- Removed most of the support for the experimental legacy clip targets (replaced with the new clip engine, which is not completely compatible with the experimental legacy clip targets)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added comprehensive support for discrete ReaLearn parameters (now you can use integers instead of only floating pointer numbers between 0.0 and 1.0)
- Added target "FX parameter: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Send: Set automation touch state"
- Added target "Track: Set monitoring mode"
- Added support for instance-specific "FX-to-preset links" (making it possible to distinguish between different controllers when using "Auto-load: Depending on focused FX")
- Added support for OSC value ranges other than 0.0 to 1.0
- Added support for OSC type tags Int and Long
- Added new context menu action "Named listed mappings after source"
- Improved keyboard source significantly (save/load, more reliable key catching, catching of modifier-only key presses, keystroke normalization for better cross-platform experience, portability warnings)
- Improved selectors "All by name" and "All selected" by allowing combinatorial explosion (you can now easily target many FX, FX parameters and sends on many tracks with just one target ... powerful, use with caution!)
- Improved OSC by using one socket for sending and receiving OSC messages (makes "respond to sender" possible, used for example by Behringer XR mixers)
- Improved user interface on macOS by taking up less vertical screen space (and a tiny bit less horizontal one, too)
- Improved (or made worse?) user interface for macOS light mode by using an ugly but at least bright scrollbar
- Improved bank-based conditional activation by making the number of banks configurable (by entering a value count for the corresponding ReaLearn parameter)
- Improved performance when automating ReaLearn parameters by not processing value updates if value didn't change
- Improved user interface layout for OSC source and target "OSC: Send message"

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added limited support for offline rendering (works now with REAPER >= v6.52+dev0323, limited to controlling FX parameters on the same track)
- Added source "Timer" for repeated triggering of arbitrary targets (you can find it in source category "REAPER", can for example be used to repeatedly send a particular OSC message, which is a precondition to support Behringer X32 OSC)
- Added work-in-progress "Keyboard" source (NO SAVE of source settings yet!)
- Added option in context menu to log not just real but also incoming/outgoing virtual control elements and values (very useful for debugging mappings)
- Added invocation mode "Absolute (7-bit)" to target "Project: Invoke REAPER action" (for controlling actions that don't correctly interpret 14-bit values, e.g. "SWS/SM: Live Config #1 - Apply config (MIDI/OSC only)")
- Added plug'n'play for MIDI devices, also on Windows (automatically resends all feedback shortly after MIDI device plugged in without further user interaction)
- Added John's presets for Behringer MOTÖR and FCB1010
- Added clip engine to be used by upcoming Playtime 2 (this is by far the biggest addition but you can't use it yet :P ... more about this in the next pre-release)
- Improved target "MIDI: Send message" by lifting all previous restrictions when using destination "FX output" (Yes, you can now play your VSTs via OSC!)
- Improved precision for entering and displaying percentages and dB to 4 fractional digits (e.g. useful for values in value sequences)
- Improved error reporting by including the name of the channel in case a channel ran full
- Improved ReaLearn plug-in topology by removing output pins (since ReaLearn doesn't output any audio streams)
- Fixed bug that caused enabling/disabling ReaLearn to have no effect when on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed white background color when using dark SWELL settings on Linux (by not enforcing any background color at all)
- Fixed bug in target "MIDI: Send message" that made repeated sending of the same value have no effect with some configurations
- Fixed sometimes missing text feedback updates for clip seek target and some other targets
- Fixed some potential errors when using "Copy as Lua"
- Fixed bug when combining conditional activation with single press fire mode (modifier firing unexpectedly)
- Removed most of the support for the experimental legacy clip targets (replaced with the new clip engine, which is not completely compatible with the experimental legacy clip targets)

            <version name="2.11.1" author="helgoboss" time="2021-12-22T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added support for textual feedback (usable with OSC String sources and MIDI hardware displays: Mackie, SiniCon)
- Added comprehensive built-in support for import and export of the all-new ReaLearn Script = Build ReaLearn presets/mappings in Lua! (Attention: Small adjustments to the ReaLearn Script API data structure are to be expected during the 2.11 and 2.12 release cycles!)
- Added completely new possibility to organize mappings - by tagging them (most new ReaLearn targets support tags to flexibly restrict the mapping scope, you can also search for them by prefixing a search term with a hash character #)
- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable instances" for flexibly enabling/disabling complete ReaLearn instances during a performance (great for paging)
- Added target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable mappings" for flexibly enabling/disabling mappings during a performance (can be used as a more straightforward alternative to conditional activation, especially when it comes to bank/zone switching scenarios)
- Added target "ReaLearn: Navigate within group" for cycling through mappings in a mapping group (for intuitively defining sequences e.g. for implementing pages, zones etc.; support sequences spanning completely different targets!)
- Added possibility to control using system-exclusive MIDI messages (by using the existing very flexible "Raw MIDI" source, which only worked for feedback direction so far - now supports learning, value extraction using patterns and logging of incoming messages)
- Added text and background color support for some MIDI controller displays that have color capabilities (at the moment SiniCon E24 and Launchpad Pro)
- Added support for Raspberry Pi (Linux armv7 and Linux aarch64)
- Added new variable 'y\_last' in EEL control transformation, which can be used to implement a performance control mode typical for a synth modulation matrix (y = y\_last + x \* (1 - y\_last))
- Added variable 'selected\_track\_indexes' array variable to dynamic expressions (making it possible to e.g. control 1st selected track with fader one, 2nd selected track with fader two, etc.)
- Added new "Track" target which is well-suited as neutral target for getting textual feedback for track properties (but will get more interesting functionality at a later stage, see #228)
- Added JSON schema of the API data structure (in order to potentially support writing ReaLearn presets/mappings in other languages as well, especially typed ones, e.g. TypeScript)
- Added header panel context menu action 'Make sources of all main mappings virtual'
- Added optional track dropdown to "Project: Invoke REAPER action" target (The target makes sure that this track is selected before executing the action. This makes it possible to combine ReaLearn's flexible track selection capabilities with the plethora of REAPER actions that work on the currently selected track.)
- Added target "Send: Automation mode"
- Added target "Send: Mono/stereo"
- Added target "Send: Phase invert/normal"
- Added target "Track: Phase invert/normal"
- Added target "Project: Any on (solo/mute/...)"
- Added "exclusive (on only)" options wherever appropriate in order to easily support exclusive toggle buttons (group interaction "inverse target value", track exclusivity, mapping/instance enable/disable exclusivity)
- Added support for (N)RPN data increment/decrement messages
- Added source "ReaLearn instance started" in source category REAPER that fires when ReaLearn is started (can be used to execute an action, restore parameter states or whatever on REAPER startup or project load)
- Added basic support for displaying scrollable text on the Launchpad Pro (also supports text color)
- Added \<New group> option to "Move to group" context menu actions
- Added place in Git repository for making unofficial 3rd-party presets available (added 2 unofficial controller presets for BCF2000 and Panorama P6)
- Added header panel context menu action 'Make targets of listed mappings sticky'
- Improved "DAW control" main preset (added support for timecode display, time mode cycling, track name and pan display, any-solo, track peak meter, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" controller presets (added support for LCD and timecode display, track peak meter and any-solo button, fixed encoder acceleration behavior, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved performance, code complexity and serialization independence of preset dirty checking by using a much simpler method than before (before: comparison of JSON; now: setting dirty flag whenever e.g. a mapping changed)
- Improved virtual control element naming by increasing maximum length from 16 to 32
- Improved wording by renaming "Tuning" to "Glue"
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by allowing to restrict snapshot loading to mappings with certain tags and activity state
- Improved auto-load preset functionality to work better with shell plug-ins, e.g. Waves (now by default uses plug-in name instead of file name to distinguish between the single plug-in types; in order for this to take effect, you need to remove each problematic link and reestablish it or edit the link and fill out the FX ID name yourself)
- Improved projection feedback by sending feedback initially, not just on value changes or on manual request via REAPER action
- Improved target value entry by providing buttons for trigger- or switch-like targets
- Improved "Toggle buttons" mode to support exclusive toggle button use cases (if target min is equal to target max, it now toggles between that specific value and zero)
- Improved \<Dynamic> track selector by allowing it to address the master track (if the expression returns value -1)
- Improved dynamic expressions by letting 'track\_selected\_index' evaluate to the special variable 'none' if no track is selected, allowing users to choose a suitable fallback in that case
- Improved dynamic expressions by making 'selected\_track\_index' and 'this\_track\_index' support master track (value -1)
- Improved dynamic expressions by making compartment parameters available as array variable 'p' (now you can write p\[0] instead of p1])
- Improved dynamic expressions by making target inactive if the expression fails (e.g. if an undefined variable is used)
- Improved Raw MIDI source to control and learn incoming short (non-sys-ex) messages as well
- Improved documentation of what's special about "MIDI: Send message" target and what limitations it has
- Improved performance of "MIDI: Send message" target when sending to feedback output by avoiding deallocation in audio thread
- Improved usability by disabling certain UI elements depending on the selected OSC argument type
- Improved user guide (structure, headings, table of contents, TouchOSC instructions)
- Fixed bug that caused project to be marked dirty on load already
- Fixed bug that caused changes to sometimes not be memorized if ReaLearn is on monitoring FX chain
- Fixed bug that caused automation to shortly jump back when writing automation via fader touch
- Fixed severe bug that could cause ReaLearn instances to receive MIDI from wrong input device
- Fixed bug that caused source takeover between ReaLearn instances with different feedback output devices

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new "Project: Any on (solo/mute/...)" target
- Added new "target.position.\*.mcu" text feedback placeholders to seek target (uses timecode formatting tailored to MCU timecode display)
- Added new "target.pan.mcu" text feedback placeholder to track pan target (uses pan formatting tailored to MCU LCD line)
- Added place in Git repository for making unofficial 3rd-party presets available (added 2 unofficial controller presets for BCF2000 and Panorama P6)
- Improved \<Dynamic> track selector by allowing it to address the master track (if the expression returns value -1)
- Improved wording by renaming "Tuning" to "Glue"
- Improved "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" controller presets (added support for LCD and timecode display, track peak meter and any-solo button, fixed encoder acceleration behavior, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved "DAW control" main preset (added support for timecode display, time mode cycling, track name and pan display, any-solo, track peak meter, many small improvements, easier to maintain because generated from ReaLearn Script)
- Improved ReaLearn Script and native ReaLearn JSON format by allowing arbitrary mapping and group IDs (not just UUIDs) and complaining if the import contains duplicate IDs
- Improved performance, code complexity and serialization independence of preset dirty checking by using a much simpler method than before (before: comparison of JSON; now: setting dirty flag whenever e.g. a mapping changed)
- Improved ReaLearn Script by renaming 'key' to 'id'
- Improved virtual control element naming by increasing maximum length from 16 to 32
- Improved Raw MIDI source to control and learn incoming short (non-sys-ex) messages as well
- Fixed pre-release regression that made on/off track targets not work anymore on master track
- Fixed bug that caused source takeover between ReaLearn instances with different feedback output devices

- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable mappings" for flexibly enabling/disabling mappings during a performance (can be used as a more straightforward alternative to conditional activation, especially when it comes to bank/zone switching scenarios)
- Added new target "ReaLearn: Enable/disable instances" for flexibly enabling/disabling complete ReaLearn instances during a performance (great for paging)
- Added completely new possibility to organize mappings - by tagging them (most new ReaLearn targets support tags to flexibly restrict the mapping scope, you can also search for them by prefixing a search term with a hash character #)
- Added new source "ReaLearn instance started" in source category REAPER that fires when ReaLearn is started (can be used to execute an actions, restore parameter states or whatever on REAPER startup or project load)
- Improved target "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" by allowing to restrict snapshot loading to mappings with certain tags and activity state
- Improved target value entry by providing buttons for trigger- or switch-like targets
- Improved projection feedback by sending feedback initially, not just on value changes or on manual request via REAPER action
- Improved performance of "MIDI: Send message" target when sending to feedback output by avoiding deallocation in audio thread

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added option "Poll for feedback" (enabled by default) to the few targets for which the REAPER API doesn't provide any value change notification or not in all cases (essentially makes automatic feedback work for all targets, also fixes the issue that switching presets from within a FX UI doesn't resend FX parameter feedback)
- Added header context menu options to log incoming/outgoing MIDI/OSC messages (great for debugging)
- Added track selector "All by name" which resolves to many tracks instead of only the first one if the name contains wildcards and multiple tracks match
- Added mapping row context menu option to log debug info for a single mapping
- Added new tuning setting "Group interaction" for controlling multiple mappings within the same group at once, in multiple interesting ways
- Added source category "None", to be used with mappings that are not supposed to be controlled directly but just via "Group interaction"
- Added support for target value sequences (including ranges, customizable step sizes etc., even supports true relative control!)
- Added target unit button for switching between 1. native target unit and 2. percentages (chosen unit will be used whenever entering/displaying target values or step sizes, saved per mapping)
- Added visual mapping (source) match indicator, both in mapping row and mapping panel
- Added "All by name" FX selector (lets you use wildcards now to resolve to multiple FX, quite useful with the "FX: Enable/disable" target for simulating controller pages)
- Added possibility to use ReaLearn as global MIDI filter (by making "Let through" checkboxes available even when choosing real hardware MIDI input device, needs REAPER >= v6.36!)
- Added source "MIDI device changes" in new source category "REAPER" (for reacting to MIDI device plug/unplug events)
- Added variable selected\_track\_index for use in dynamic track expression
- Added a very work-in-progress version of the new "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" target (only restores the initial target values of all instance mappings at the moment but will become much more powerful in future)
- Internal change: Added and changed code for upcoming "Discrete processing" feature (#184)
- Added mapping option "Show in projection" (enabled by default)
- Added controller preset and instructions for "Arturia KeyLab MkII" (thanks to dissofiddle)
- Improved usability by putting "Send feedback after control" and "Prevent echo feedback" into dropdown (because it doesn't make sense to combine them)
- Improved versatility of "Make absolute" checkbox by also making it available in "Incremental buttons" mode
- Improved jump settings by displaying and letting one enter step sizes instead of absolute values (makes much more sense)
- Improved error handling by logging details when not being able to load a preset
- Improved error handling by displaying instructions on what to do when encountering a preset saved with a newer version
- Improved error handling by logging only the first warning message in a sequence of equal warning messages
- Improved UI semantics by renaming target category "REAPER" to "Real"
- Improved usability by disallowing addressing FX "By ID" if the track is not sticky (that is, not \<This> or addressed "By ID") ... allowing was nonsensical and confusing
- Improved FX parameter "By position" selector so you can enter the position in a text field (parameter dropdown is now available as selector "By ID")
- Improved consistency of target label in mapping row (e.g. don't show resolved track/FX/parameter name if selector is not "By ID")
- Improved usability of target dropdowns by making it possible to change the track/FX selectors while keeping entered values (e.g. having the name always prefilled when switching from "By ID" to "By name")
- Improved user guide (better table of contents, better quick start, migrated to AsciiDoc)
- Improved projection by sending projection feedback even if feedback disabled for controller mapping
- Improved fire mode "After timeout" by making it work in combination with "Press only" button filter (you can now press a button and no matter how long you press it, it will fire after the specified timeout)
- Improved versatility by guaranteeing mappings within one compartment to be processed in the order of definition (exception: ReaLearn parameters)
- Improved "MIDI/OSC: Send message" targets by making it work with "Toggle buttons" mode and relative encoders
- Improved performance for targets that poll for feedback (e.g. "Track: Peak") by processing and sending feedback only if value actually changed
- Improved reliability by migrating to stable Rust (just an internal change)
- Fixed "nervous motor faders" issue by not sending batch feedback anymore when starting to play or seeking
- Fixed predefined "MIDI: Send" target patterns (7-bit patterns reported to be 14-bit-capable)
- Fixed takeover modes misbehavior in presence of restricted source/target value range
- Fixed bug that let "Send feedback after control" not send feedback after control in some corner cases
- Fixed "Last touched" target: Make it work correctly if other FX parameter is currently automated (also improves FX parameter learning in presence of parameter automation)
- Fixed error "REAPER string should be UTF-8 encoded" with certain FX parameter names
- Fixed bug that caused "The pipe is being closed" error on some systems when choosing "MIDI: Send message" target
- Fixed non-reliable dynamic selectors for send, FX and FX parameters (was only working reliably for tracks before)
- Fixed MiniLab mkII controller preset: Projection feedback for pads works now
- Fixed confusing logic that caused the preset save button to not be greyed out after making mappings project-independent
- Fixed lag when sending MIDI messages to FX output (both when letting incoming messages through and when sending them via "MIDI: Send message" target)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn send targets to forget the kind of send

- Added a very work-in-progress version of the new "ReaLearn: Load mapping snapshot" target (only restores the initial target values of all instance mappings at the moment but will become much more powerful in future)
- Fixed non-working group interaction feature for OSC and REAPER sources

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added visual mapping (source) match indicator, both in mapping row and mapping panel
- Added "All by name" FX selector (lets you use wildcards now to resolve to multiple FX, quite useful with the "FX: Enable/disable" target for simulating controller pages)
- Improved usability by disallowing addressing FX "By ID" if the track is not sticky (that is, not \<This> or addressed "By ID") ... allowing was nonsensical and confusing
- Improved FX parameter "By position" selector so you can enter the position in a text field (parameter dropdown is now available as selector "By ID")
- Improved consistency of target label in mapping row (e.g. don't show resolved track/FX/parameter name if selector is not "By ID")
- Improved usability of target dropdowns by making it possible to change the track/FX selectors while keeping entered values (e.g. having the name always prefilled when switching from "By ID" to "By name")
- Improved user guide (better table of contents, better quick start, migrated to AsciiDoc)
- Improved projection by sending projection feedback even if feedback disabled for controller mapping
- Fixed takeover modes misbehavior in presence of restricted source/target value range
- Fixed bug that let "Send feedback after control" not send feedback after control in some corner cases
- Fixed "Last touched" target: Make it work correctly if other FX parameter is currently automated (also improves FX parameter learning in presence of parameter automation)

- Added mapping row context menu option to log debug info for a single mapping
- Improved performance for targets that poll for feedback (e.g. "Track: Peak") by processing and sending feedback only if value actually changed

- Fixed "nervous motor faders" issue by not sending batch feedback anymore when starting to play or seeking
- Fixed predefined "MIDI: Send" target patterns (7-bit patterns reported to be 14-bit-capable)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added experimental targets "Clip: Invoke transport action", "Clip: Seek" and "Clip: Volume"
- Added new FX instance selector "Dynamic"
- Added new FX parameter selectors "Dynamic" and "By name"
- Added new send/receive/output selectors "Dynamic", "By ID" (source/destination track ID) and "By name"
- Added option to use track receives (change of perspective) and hardware output sends instead of track sends only
- Added possibility to use wildcards (\* and ?) in all name selectors to match only parts of names
- Added "Fire after timeout" mode for button presses
- Added "Fire after timeout, keep firing" mode for button presses (turbo mode!)
- Added "Seek" target (including feedback on beat changes or in high resolution!)
- Added support for showing current target values in projection view (= "Projection feedback", needs latest version of the ReaLearn Companion app to work)
- Added takeover modes "Parallel" and "Catch up" (renamed existing takeover modes to "Pick up" and "Long time no see")
- Added FX selector \<This> for targeting the own ReaLearn instance (good for using conditional activation and \<Dynamic> in reusable presets)
- Added copy/paste of mappings or even just sources/modes/targets (also across compartments and instances)
- Added copy/paste of the complete filtered mapping list (e.g. to copy/paste whole compartments, groups or search results)
- Added possibility to use names for virtual control elements instead of numbers
- Added quick start section at the top of the user guide
- Added FAQ section to the user guide
- Added mapping group feature to controller compartment (was previously available in main compartment only)
- Added conditional activation to controller compartment (was previously available in main compartment only)
- Added 100 more freely assignable VST parameters to ReaLearn (now we have 200 parameters in total divided into the already existing 100 main compartment parameters and 100 new controller compartment parameters)
- Added possibility to customize parameter names via header panel context menu
- Added ability for "Auto-load preset: Depending on focused FX" instances to suspend other instances that share the same device (with this, you can easily let your controller control the currently focused FX but fall back to your usual controls when it's closed)
- Added ability that multiple instances work hand in hand when it comes to feedback (As long as 2 instances don't actively feedback to more than one control element at once, everything will be fine and should work just as with conditional activation within 1 instance.)
- Added new targets "FX open" (for opening/closing a specific FX via button) and "FX navigate" (for navigating with prev/next buttons or encoders within FX chain)
- Added new targets "Track automation mode" and "Automation mode override"
- Added new target "Track show/hide"
- Added new transport actions "Pause" and "Stop" to "Transport target" (for more fine-grained feedback)
- Added checkboxes "Scroll TCP" and "Scroll mixer" to targets "Selected track" and "Track selection"
- Added checkboxes "Set loop points" and "Set time selection" to target "Go to region"
- Added "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" to header context menu
- Added "FX-to-preset links" to header context menu for better management and for making it possible to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset
- Added possibility to use plug-in file name wildcards (\* and ?) when linking an FX to a preset (another way to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset)
- Added new source character "Toggle button" as a workaround for hardware buttons that can't be configured to act as momentary buttons (should usually be avoided; behavior is that it always sends 1 even when 0 is received)
- Added new fire modes "Single press" and "Double press" (can now distinguish between single press, double press and long press)
- Added possibility to use preset name in addition to plug-in name when creating preset links for the "Auto-load preset" feature (allows you to load a different ReaLearn main preset when the preset of the focused FX changes)
- Added ability to correctly switch feedback when enabling/disabling ReaLearn instances that talk to the same control elements (uses source-takeover mechanism)
- Added possibility to easily react to button press-down only and ignore button release (without affecting feedback)
- Added possibility to easily react to encoder increments or decrements only
- Added possibility to let the target track depend on the current position of this ReaLearn track by making variable this\_track\_index available in the \<Dynamic> track expression
- Added support for keeping control/feedback working even when switching to other project tab (with exception of automation writing, "Project: Set playrate" target and the smooth region seeking part of "Marker/region: Go to" target)
- Added possibility to enforce "Rotate" already in a virtual controller mapping
- Added feedback-only "Script" MIDI source for making LCD support possible (lets you write EEL scripts that encode the target value as raw MIDI message in any imaginable way)
- Added library of Mackie-inspired virtual control element names and a convenient picker
- Added capability for automatic naming of mappings based on its target - kicks in when clearing the custom name
- Added right-click menu action to auto-name listed mappings (clearing all names)
- Added main preset "DAW Control" to ReaPack repository and documented it in the user guide in the new "Preset" section
- Added user guide entry for controller "Behringer X-Touch One"
- Added support for wildcards in search expressions
- Added context-sensitive help section to mapping panel which explains most of the tuning options (for each kind of source separately)
- Added target "MIDI: Send message"
- Added target "OSC: Send message"
- Added new track selector "All selected" to make track targets (NOT FX and send targets) work on all selected tracks
- Added right-click menu action "Move listed mappings to group"
- Improved compartment presets by making them save/restore the customized compartment parameter names as well
- Improved feedback for controller mappings with virtual targets (enabling it again will restore feedback, that was previously not the case)
- Improved understandability by renaming "Program" to "Bank" in conditional activation
- Improved usability by renaming and reordering targets, also introduced additional target hint label
- Improved "Project: Invoke transport action" target by making "Play/stop" and "Play/pause" retriggerable
- Improved user interface by displaying helpful text and button if compartment, group or filtered list empty
- Improved user interface by moving "Reload all" to the header right-click context menu as "Reload all presets from disk"
- Improved user interface by displaying mapping compartments as radio buttons
- Improved user interface by hiding "Let through" options when input is not \<FX input> (change in behavior: now it will always let through FX input events in that case)
- Improved user interface by marking "Toggle buttons" mode as invalid for virtual controller mappings
- Improved versatility by making "Character" dropdown available even for 14-bit sources (both (N)RPN and CC)
- Improved controller presets "Mackie Control" and "iCON Platform M+" by using virtual control element names of the new "DAW" domain (major version bump, breaking change ... but no worries, your existing projects, FX chains and track templates will not be changed unless you explicitly reload the preset within ReaLearn)

- Improved "Duplicate" by getting rid of the annoying "Copy of ..." prefix
- Improved usability by hiding mapping tuning options which are not relevant at all in the current context
- Improved user friendliness by raising step size max to 5% and speed max to 5x (in order to make it more obvious to new users that ReaLearn supports encoder acceleration and velocity-sensitive buttons)
- Improved usability by removing the UI difference between numbered and named virtual control elements (internally numbers are still treated a bit differently, but on the surface it's the same now)
- Improved usability by explicitly indicating when target is currently inactive
- Improved naming by renaming "Rotate" to "Wrap" and "Move instance to upper floor" to "Make instance superior"
- Improved Midi Fighter Twister user guide entry by explaining how to use encoder acceleration and by linking to ReaLearn-compatible MFT Color Designer web app
- Improved Midi Fighter Twister controller presets by making it react to encoder acceleration if configured in MF utility (also use named virtual control IDs for side buttons)
- Improved preset behavior by automatically resetting all compartment parameters to zero when loading a compartment preset
- Improved global "Find first mapping by source" REAPER action by taking mapping activation status into account
- Fixed error when controlling "Last touched" target after the last touched target is gone (e.g. after track deleted)
- Fixed too early rotation when using "Incremental buttons" in combination with "Rotate"
- Fixed bug in "Go to marger/region" target that caused markers/regions to be triggered even on button release

- Fixed possible "unwrap" error with certain mapping tuning settings, e.g. jump and step size
- Fixed possible "borrow" error when using FX parameter target with own ReaLearn instance

- Fixed "FX chain chunk not found" error when on monitoring FX and "Auto-load preset" on
- Fixed sometimes missing feedback on target activation changes (e.g. when "Track must be selected" is used)
- Fixed \<Dynamic> expression evaluation by doing rounding (was sometimes leading to unexpected results because decimal digits were just being cut off)
- Fixed cropped "Min" labels on macOS
- Fixed little GUI lag when selecting control element index for virtual targets
- Fixed bug on macOS which caused text fields not to update correctly if still focused
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error on macOS when doing things while text field still focused

- Improved target track picker GUI by making it easier to create ReaLearn presets that are going to be used across different projects (e.g. "By name" now lets you enter a string as one would expect)
- Improved performance by trying to not send too much unnecessary feedback when mapping or mapping target activation states change
- Improved handling of REAPER's "Audio device closed" state (in ReaLearn < 2.5.0 being in that state for a long time could have led to slow memory exhaustion, in ReaLearn < 2.7.0 it would eventually lead to an error message "Full" instead - which is already better, and in 2.7.0 it's handled as it probably should)
- Fixed error message complaining about negative positions when using count-in and sometimes when playing from the very project start (introduced in 2.6.0)
- Improved usability by not intentionally generating a backtrace when pressing "Log debug info" (that caused confusion)
- Improved usability by reducing likelihood for audio dropouts by avoiding allocation in real-time thread when using very many mappings (probably premature optimization)

- Improved usability of min/max text fields on Windows and macOS by changing the value (and correcting the other value) not before leaving the field instead of immediately (the behavior before that was downright annoying as you can see here)
- Improved editing of advanced mapping settings by opening a dedicated small edit window with instant error checking (instead of just opening the system text editor, which sometimes doesn't work)
- Fixed possible "Full" error message when having projects with very many tracks
- Fixed possible error message with "Master tempo" target when mapping panel open

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added foundation for setting advanced aspects of mappings via textual configuration (accessible via new mapping panel button "Advanced settings")
- Added foundation for using very device-specific features by allowing to send a bunch of raw MIDI data (including SysEx!) on mapping activation/deactivation (see user guide section "Advanced settings" for details)
- Added option "Can deal with OSC bundles" to OSC device popup menu which can be unticked in order to achieve compatibility with devices not supporting them (e.g. Behringer mixers)
- Added user guide entries and controller presets for PreSonus FaderPort 8 and FaderPort Classic
- Improved reliability by avoiding memory exhaustion in the presence of potential programming errors (internally use bounded channels instead of unbounded one)
- Improved user guide and projection instructions by explaining how to open a context menu
- Fixed possible folder overflow with the "Exclusive: Within folder" setting introduced in the previous release
- Fixed non-occurring mapping row target label updates when track list changes
- Fixed sometimes non-arriving MIDI feedback on project load

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added "Exclusive" dropdown to all "track property on/off"-style targets (arm, selection, mute, solo, fx all enable, automation touch state) which even allows "Exclusive within folder" behavior (my personal favorite)
- Added "Automation touch state" target in order to support "Touch" automation mode for volume, pan and width envelopes (e.g. with touch-sensitive faders or push encoders)
- Added option "Behavior" for "Track solo" target, start using the routing-friendly "Solo in front" behavior by default
- Added REAPER action "ReaLearn: Send feedback for all instances" (useful mainly for debugging purposes because ReaLearn usually sends feedback automatically)
- Improved "Track solo" target by making it work with "Options → Solo in front"
- Improved usability by clearing feedback (switch off lights or turn down motorized faders) when closing ReaLearn instance or REAPER project
- Improved "Track mute" target by making it work reliably also on master track and by making feedback from automation work
- Improved usability by disabling learning of "Track selection" target if REAPER preference "Mouse click on volume/pan faders and track buttons changes track selection" enabled (in order to avoid false positives, preference change respected after REAPER restart)
- Improved usability by making "Master tempo" target uneligible as "Last touched" target and for learning in general (there were too many false positives and it could get annoying at times, just select the target manually in the dropdown to use it)
- Improved usability by letting the user confirm before globally removing an OSC device
- Improved usability by not firing immediately when changing the encoder turning direction while using a negative "Speed" setting (that was annoying and could result in sudden unwanted parameter changes)
- Improved usability by not annoying user with error messages when controlling just because they use some setting that doesn't make sense (such as controlling relative targets with absolute messages)
- Improved usability by clearing feedback of the previous source if a mapping source is changed
- Fixed non-working automation writing for "Track width" target when controlled via relative encoder
- Fixed often missing initial feedback for virtual controller mappings (LEDs were sometimes not updated before interacting with the project, e.g. by pressing play)
- Fixed possible "assertion failed: 0.0 <= normalized\_value || normalized\_value.is\_nan()" error with volume targets
- Fixed recent bug that caused "Track selection" target to be learned with wrong track (the previously selected one instead of the newly selected)
- Fixed recent bug that caused wrong "Selected track" target feedback

            <version name="2.0.1" author="helgoboss" time="2021-02-10T12:00:00Z">
                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added a bunch of controller presets
- Added possibility to refer to a track via its name or position (as an alternative to the default of using its unique and stable ID) ← That's called track anchors, a powerful addition, if you ask me!
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "\<Focused>" (analogously to track "\<Selected>")
- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.20)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Added possibility to use preset "Reset to factory default" to clear all settings, groups and mappings (without changing the session ID)
- Added user guide sections "Tested controllers" and "Tutorials"
- Added experimental new option 'Make absolute' in order to convert relative to absolute values (lets you use EEL control transformation with encoders)
- Added powerful REAPER actions for learning and finding mappings without opening ReaLearn
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Improved usability by making most confirmation and alert dialogs modal with respect to the ReaLearn window itself, not REAPER
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Improved usability by including source character in mapping row source label (makes it easier to spot character guessing issues)
- Improved (N)RPN scanning to support popular controllers (such as Behringer BCR2000), prefer value-MSB-first now
- Improved user interface by making mapping rows less grey and adding some horizontal rules
- Improved usability by making "Absolute" the default invocation mode for actions, was "Trigger" before (this change could break some action mappings done with previous 1.12.0 prereleases)
- Improved "Length" sliders to work for "Incremental buttons" mode, too
- Improved usability by always sorting groups alphabetically
- Improved usage of ReaLearn as monitoring FX by making parameter feedback and learning work (usually, REAPER extensions don't get notified of anything happening on the monitoring FX chain, but at least for ReaLearn parameter changes I managed to create a workaround ... which is good news especially for global conditional activation use cases)
- Improved user guide (related to keyboard input, monitoring FX and limitations of monitoring FX)
- Improved safety by warning whenever loading something made in a newer ReaLearn version than the current one (version number gets part of the preset data, that also paves the way for preset migration)
- Improved usability by preferring position anchors over ID anchors when learning from a ReaLearn instance that is on the monitoring FX chain
- Improved wording related to encoders, renamed internal named parameter for setting state to 'set-state'
- Improved usability by making ID now really the new default FX anchor, not 'ID or position'
- Improved awareness by changing the prime EEL control transformation example into an actually very useful one: a curve
- Improved usability by indicating if MIDI input or output device disabled in REAPER preferences
- Improved behavior by disabling control (not just feedback) for disabled ReaLearn FX instances (before this, it still kept controlling when a device was selected as 'MIDI control input')
- Improved projection QR code detection rate by greatly simplifying it for now (doesn't carry certificate content anymore, which was only useful when using web-based companion app from mobile device, which is an edge case, especially considering that an iOS app is on the way)
- Improved usability by automatically switch off source/target filter learning when doing certain UI interactions
- Fixed nonsense learning of virtual sources in controller mappings compartment (that was really bad for batch learning control elements)
- Fixed missing mapping lanel UI update when learning other parameter of same FX
- Fixed 'Solo' target learning (was always resulting in master track)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn-monitoring-FX controlled targets to become sticky when switching between project tabs (not updating correctly)
- Fixed error message when pressing space bar in an empty ReaLearn instance
- Fixed possible "Raw pointer..." error when using track selection targets
- Fixed possible "couldn't get FX param value..." error when using FX parameter target
- Fixed action invocation mode "trigger", which sometimes wouldn't fire
- Fixed misleading labels in mapping panel
- Fixed feedback when reverse enabled and target range non-symmetric
- Fixed bug with broken plug-ins that report parameter as discrete but with a nonsensical step size of zero
- Fixed broken arrow symbols on Windows 7 (display rectangles instead of arrows)
- Fixed "Couldn't get preset count" error
- Fixed (N)RPN learning and consumption check
- Fixed wrong info that feedback not working for (N)RPN (it works!)
- Fixed "Track send pan" target (was confused with "Track send volume")
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action
- Fixed "is not a valid unit value" error (happened when reading volume values above the fader limit set in REAPER preferences)
- Fixed "negative MIDI frame offset" error (negative offsets are interpreted as zero now)
- Fixed "Message: assertion failed: Bpm::is\_valid(value)" error (could happen when using controllers that send MIDI clock)
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" error (caused by unexpected FX parameter change value)
- Fixed Windows 7 character issues in dropdown menus
- Fixed error message if track could not be found
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed
- Fixed auto correction for "Send feedback only if track armed"
- Fixed bug that could cause target value to get stuck if step size too small when it could be avoided
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error and potential race conditions when "Allow live FX multiprocessing" enabled
- Fixed segmentation fault on Linux when loading ReaLearn after plug-in scan
- Fixed wrong reverse behavior in 'Normal' mode when target value range is non-symmetric (old presets will keep their wrong behavior in order to not break existing projects)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.19+dev1226)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed possible crash when REAPER preference "Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins" is set (projection server now completely unloads and releases TCP ports when removing the last ReaLearn instance)
- Fixed serialization bug that caused source channel and number to be skipped from serialization and loaded as 0 instead of  (THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR 1.12 PRERELEASE PRESETS/PROJECTS, SORRY! When loading with pre9, check if there are any sources that unwillingly contains \<Any> as channel or number, manually change it to 0 and save the project/preset!)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed

The ones delivered by ReaPack should be moved automatically when doing a ReaPack sync.)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "\<Focused>" (analogously to track "\<Selected>")
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by prompting user for confirmation before switching from no preset to some preset if there are mappings defined already
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)

- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action

- Added transport target with proper feedback (play/pause, play/stop, record, repeat)
- Added option to send feedback after each control cycle
- Added possibility to further specify "Out of range" behavior (the new option "Min" is especially useful for mappings where a button sets a target to a specific constant value)
- Improved installation instructions and added controller tips to the documentation
- Improved usability by showing hierarchical folder structure in track dropdown
- Improved usability by asking user for confirmation before removing a mapping
- Improved usability by simplifying mapping window title
- Fixed strange and unreliable feedback if target min is equal to target max
- Fixed bug that caused "FX must have focus" to not work at all with floating windows and work incorrectly when in FX chain

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track
