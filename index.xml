                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new targets "FX open" (for opening/closing a specific FX via button) and "FX navigate" (for navigating with prev/next buttons or encoders within FX chain)
- Added new targets "Track automation mode" and "Automation mode override"
- Added new target "Track show/hide"
- Added new transport actions "Pause" and "Stop" to "Transport target" (for more fine-grained feedback)
- Added checkboxes "Scroll TCP" and "Scroll mixer" to targets "Selected track" and "Track selection"
- Added checkboxes "Set loop points" and "Set time selection" to target "Go to region"
- Added "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" to header context menu
- Added "FX-to-preset links" to header context menu for better management and for making it possible to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset
- Added possibility to use plug-in file name wildcards (\* and ?) when linking an FX to a preset (another way to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset)
- Added new source character "Toggle button" as a workaround for hardware buttons that can't be configured to act as momentary buttons (should usually be avoided; behavior is that it always sends 1 even when 0 is received)
- Improved understandability by renaming "Program" to "Bank" in conditional activation
- Fixed feedback issues due to numerical inaccuracies (especially useful for radio-button-like feedback from discrete target values)
- Fixed "FX chain chunk not found" error when on monitoring FX and "Auto-load preset" on
- Fixed sometimes missing feedback on target activation changes (e.g. when "Track must be selected" is used)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added ability for "Auto-load preset: Depending on focused FX" instances to cancel other instances that share the same device (with this, you can easily let your controller control the currently focused FX but fall back to your usual controls when it's closed)
- Added ability that multiple instances work hand in hand when it comes to feedback (As long as 2 instances don't actively feedback to more than one control element at once, everything will be fine and should work just as with conditional activation within 1 instance.)
- Improved UI in minor ways
- Improved usability by respecting activation state of controller mappings with virtual targets when learning a main mapping source
- Improved usability by showing only short parameter name in conditional activation parameter dropdowns
- Fixed annoying bug that made group changes have an effect only ever in one of the compartments

- Added possibility to customize parameter names via header panel context menu
- Improved compartment presets by making them save/restore the customized compartment parameter names as well
- Improved companion app value projection feedback by updating the feedback in more cases if "Feedback output" is "None"
- Improved feedback for controller mappings with virtual targets (enabling it again will restore feedback, that was previously not the case)
- Fixed UI for controller mappings with virtual targets (previously showed advanced fire modes although not supported for virtual targets)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new track type "Dynamic" (allows to calculate a track number depending on ReaLearn's internal parameter values)
- Improved target track picker GUI by making it easier to create ReaLearn presets that are going to be used across different projects (e.g. "By name" now lets you enter a string as one would expect)
- Improved performance by trying to not send too much unnecessary feedback when mapping or mapping target activation states change
- Improved handling of REAPER's "Audio device closed" state (in ReaLearn &lt; 2.5.0 being in that state for a long time could have led to slow memory exhaustion, in ReaLearn &lt; 2.7.0 it would eventually lead to an error message "Full" instead - which is already better, and in 2.7.0 it's handled as it probably should)
- Fixed error message complaining about negative positions when using count-in and sometimes when playing from the very project start (introduced in 2.6.0)
- Improved usability by not intentionally generating a backtrace when pressing "Log debug info" (that caused confusion)
- Improved usability by reducing likelihood for audio dropouts by avoiding allocation in real-time thread when using very many mappings (probably premature optimization)
- Fixed another possible error message when closing a project while ReaLearn is open

- Added very flexible feedback-only "Raw MIDI" source in order to support feedback on controllers whose LEDs etc. can only be controlled via system-exclusive MIDI messages (e.g. Arturia MiniLab mkII)
- Added user guide entry and controller preset for Arturia MiniLab mkII (pad feedback now works thanks to ReaLearn's new sys-ex support!)
- Added user guide entry for OSC/PILOT
- Improved usability of min/max text fields on Windows and macOS by changing the value (and correcting the other value) not before leaving the field instead of immediately (the behavior before that was downright annoying as you can see here)
- Improved editing of advanced mapping settings by opening a dedicated small edit window with instant error checking (instead of just opening the system text editor, which sometimes doesn't work)

- Added "Automation touch state" target in order to support "Touch" automation mode for volume, pan and width envelopes (e.g. with touch-sensitive faders or push encoders)
- Added option "Behavior" for "Track solo" target, start using the routing-friendly "Solo in front" behavior by default
- Added REAPER action "ReaLearn: Send feedback for all instances" (useful mainly for debugging purposes because ReaLearn usually sends feedback automatically)
- Improved "Track solo" target by making it work with "Options → Solo in front"
- Improved usability by clearing feedback (switch off lights or turn down motorized faders) when closing ReaLearn instance or REAPER project
- Improved "Track mute" target by making it work reliably also on master track and by making feedback from automation work
- Improved usability by disabling learning of "Track selection" target if REAPER preference "Mouse click on volume/pan faders and track buttons changes track selection" enabled (in order to avoid false positives, preference change respected after REAPER restart)
- Improved usability by making "Master tempo" target uneligible as "Last touched" target and for learning in general (there were too many false positives and it could get annoying at times, just select the target manually in the dropdown to use it)
- Improved usability by letting the user confirm before globally removing an OSC device
- Improved usability by not firing immediately when changing the encoder turning direction while using a negative "Speed" setting (that was annoying and could result in sudden unwanted parameter changes)
- Improved usability by not annoying user with error messages when controlling just because they use some setting that doesn't make sense (such as controlling relative targets with absolute messages)
- Improved usability by clearing feedback of the previous source if a mapping source is changed
- Fixed non-working automation writing for "Track width" target when controlled via relative encoder
- Fixed often missing initial feedback for virtual controller mappings (LEDs were sometimes not updated before interacting with the project, e.g. by pressing play)
- Fixed possible "assertion failed: 0.0 &lt;= normalized_value || normalized_value.is_nan()" error with volume targets
- Fixed recent bug that caused "Track selection" target to be learned with wrong track (the previously selected one instead of the newly selected)
- Fixed recent bug that caused wrong "Selected track" target feedback

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added a bunch of controller presets
- Added possibility to refer to a track via its name or position (as an alternative to the default of using its unique and stable ID) ← That's called track anchors, a powerful addition, if you ask me!
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "&lt;Focused>" (analogously to track "&lt;Selected>")
- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.20)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Added possibility to use preset "Reset to factory default" to clear all settings, groups and mappings (without changing the session ID)
- Added user guide sections "Tested controllers" and "Tutorials"
- Added experimental new option 'Make absolute' in order to convert relative to absolute values (lets you use EEL control transformation with encoders)
- Added powerful REAPER actions for learning and finding mappings without opening ReaLearn
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Improved usability by making most confirmation and alert dialogs modal with respect to the ReaLearn window itself, not REAPER
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Improved usability by including source character in mapping row source label (makes it easier to spot character guessing issues)
- Improved (N)RPN scanning to support popular controllers (such as Behringer BCR2000), prefer value-MSB-first now
- Improved user interface by making mapping rows less grey and adding some horizontal rules
- Improved usability by making "Absolute" the default invocation mode for actions, was "Trigger" before (this change could break some action mappings done with previous 1.12.0 prereleases)
- Improved "Length" sliders to work for "Incremental buttons" mode, too
- Improved usability by always sorting groups alphabetically
- Improved usage of ReaLearn as monitoring FX by making parameter feedback and learning work (usually, REAPER extensions don't get notified of anything happening on the monitoring FX chain, but at least for ReaLearn parameter changes I managed to create a workaround ... which is good news especially for global conditional activation use cases)
- Improved user guide (related to keyboard input, monitoring FX and limitations of monitoring FX)
- Improved safety by warning whenever loading something made in a newer ReaLearn version than the current one (version number gets part of the preset data, that also paves the way for preset migration)
- Improved usability by preferring position anchors over ID anchors when learning from a ReaLearn instance that is on the monitoring FX chain
- Improved wording related to encoders, renamed internal named parameter for setting state to 'set-state'
- Improved usability by making ID now really the new default FX anchor, not 'ID or position'
- Improved awareness by changing the prime EEL control transformation example into an actually very useful one: a curve
- Improved usability by indicating if MIDI input or output device disabled in REAPER preferences
- Improved behavior by disabling control (not just feedback) for disabled ReaLearn FX instances (before this, it still kept controlling when a device was selected as 'MIDI control input')
- Improved projection QR code detection rate by greatly simplifying it for now (doesn't carry certificate content anymore, which was only useful when using web-based companion app from mobile device, which is an edge case, especially considering that an iOS app is on the way)
- Improved usability by automatically switch off source/target filter learning when doing certain UI interactions
- Fixed nonsense learning of virtual sources in controller mappings compartment (that was really bad for batch learning control elements)
- Fixed missing mapping lanel UI update when learning other parameter of same FX
- Fixed 'Solo' target learning (was always resulting in master track)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn-monitoring-FX controlled targets to become sticky when switching between project tabs (not updating correctly)
- Fixed error message when pressing space bar in an empty ReaLearn instance
- Fixed possible "Raw pointer..." error when using track selection targets
- Fixed possible "couldn't get FX param value..." error when using FX parameter target
- Fixed action invocation mode "trigger", which sometimes wouldn't fire
- Fixed misleading labels in mapping panel
- Fixed feedback when reverse enabled and target range non-symmetric
- Fixed bug with broken plug-ins that report parameter as discrete but with a nonsensical step size of zero
- Fixed broken arrow symbols on Windows 7 (display rectangles instead of arrows)
- Fixed "Couldn't get preset count" error
- Fixed (N)RPN learning and consumption check
- Fixed wrong info that feedback not working for (N)RPN (it works!)
- Fixed "Track send pan" target (was confused with "Track send volume")
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action
- Fixed "is not a valid unit value" error (happened when reading volume values above the fader limit set in REAPER preferences)
- Fixed "negative MIDI frame offset" error (negative offsets are interpreted as zero now)
- Fixed "Message: assertion failed: Bpm::is_valid(value)" error (could happen when using controllers that send MIDI clock)
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" error (caused by unexpected FX parameter change value)
- Fixed Windows 7 character issues in dropdown menus
- Fixed error message if track could not be found
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed
- Fixed auto correction for "Send feedback only if track armed"
- Fixed bug that could cause target value to get stuck if step size too small when it could be avoided
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error and potential race conditions when "Allow live FX multiprocessing" enabled
- Fixed segmentation fault on Linux when loading ReaLearn after plug-in scan
- Fixed wrong reverse behavior in 'Normal' mode when target value range is non-symmetric (old presets will keep their wrong behavior in order to not break existing projects)

- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed possible crash when REAPER preference "Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins" is set (projection server now completely unloads and releases TCP ports when removing the last ReaLearn instance)
- Fixed serialization bug that caused source channel and number to be skipped from serialization and loaded as 0 instead of  (THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR 1.12 PRERELEASE PRESETS/PROJECTS, SORRY! When loading with pre9, check if there are any sources that unwillingly contains &lt;Any> as channel or number, manually change it to 0 and save the project/preset!)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" in a better way (translating negative values to zero instead of ignoring them)
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed UI inconsistency by hiding track anchor dropdown if not relevant

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 ReaLearn is a VST instrument plug-in which works in REAPER only. Its purpose is to improve REAPER\u8217's MIDI learn capabilities and add MIDI feedback (e.g.\u160?via LEDs and motorized faders). If you frequently need to map MIDI controller elements like knobs or switches to REAPER functions such as FX parameters or actions, ReaLearn might be useful for you.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 REAPER itself has this capability but some useful MIDI control scenarios are quite difficult and time-consuming to achieve with REAPER alone, for example if you want to restrict the controlled target value range. You would need to tinker with things like MIDIToReaControlPath and general purpose MIDI plug-ins. ReaLearn tries to make that much easier by giving you instant and easy access to lots of advanced features out-of-the-box.\par}

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added new targets "FX open" (for opening/closing a specific FX via button) and "FX navigate" (for navigating with prev/next buttons or encoders within FX chain)
- Added new targets "Track automation mode" and "Automation mode override"
- Added new target "Track show/hide"
- Added new transport actions "Pause" and "Stop" to "Transport target" (for more fine-grained feedback)
- Added checkboxes "Scroll TCP" and "Scroll mixer" to targets "Selected track" and "Track selection"
- Added checkboxes "Set loop points" and "Set time selection" to target "Go to region"
- Added "Paste mappings (replace all in group)" to header context menu
- Added "FX-to-preset links" to header context menu for better management and for making it possible to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset
- Added possibility to use plug-in file name wildcards (\* and ?) when linking an FX to a preset (another way to map multiple plug-ins to the same preset)
- Added new source character "Toggle button" as a workaround for hardware buttons that can't be configured to act as momentary buttons (should usually be avoided; behavior is that it always sends 1 even when 0 is received)
- Improved understandability by renaming "Program" to "Bank" in conditional activation
- Fixed feedback issues due to numerical inaccuracies (especially useful for radio-button-like feedback from discrete target values)
- Fixed "FX chain chunk not found" error when on monitoring FX and "Auto-load preset" on
- Fixed sometimes missing feedback on target activation changes (e.g. when "Track must be selected" is used)

- Added ability that multiple instances work hand in hand when it comes to feedback (As long as 2 instances don't actively feedback to more than one control element at once, everything will be fine and should work just as with conditional activation within 1 instance.)
- Improved UI in minor ways
- Improved usability by respecting activation state of controller mappings with virtual targets when learning a main mapping source
- Improved usability by showing only short parameter name in conditional activation parameter dropdowns
- Fixed annoying bug that made group changes have an effect only ever in one of the compartments

- Improved target track picker GUI by making it easier to create ReaLearn presets that are going to be used across different projects (e.g. "By name" now lets you enter a string as one would expect)
- Improved performance by trying to not send too much unnecessary feedback when mapping or mapping target activation states change
- Improved handling of REAPER's "Audio device closed" state (in ReaLearn &lt; 2.5.0 being in that state for a long time could have led to slow memory exhaustion, in ReaLearn &lt; 2.7.0 it would eventually lead to an error message "Full" instead - which is already better, and in 2.7.0 it's handled as it probably should)
- Fixed error message complaining about negative positions when using count-in and sometimes when playing from the very project start (introduced in 2.6.0)
- Improved usability by not intentionally generating a backtrace when pressing "Log debug info" (that caused confusion)
- Improved usability by reducing likelihood for audio dropouts by avoiding allocation in real-time thread when using very many mappings (probably premature optimization)

- Improved usability of min/max text fields on Windows and macOS by changing the value (and correcting the other value) not before leaving the field instead of immediately (the behavior before that was downright annoying as you can see here)
- Improved editing of advanced mapping settings by opening a dedicated small edit window with instant error checking (instead of just opening the system text editor, which sometimes doesn't work)

- Added "Automation touch state" target in order to support "Touch" automation mode for volume, pan and width envelopes (e.g. with touch-sensitive faders or push encoders)
- Added option "Behavior" for "Track solo" target, start using the routing-friendly "Solo in front" behavior by default
- Added REAPER action "ReaLearn: Send feedback for all instances" (useful mainly for debugging purposes because ReaLearn usually sends feedback automatically)
- Improved "Track solo" target by making it work with "Options → Solo in front"
- Improved usability by clearing feedback (switch off lights or turn down motorized faders) when closing ReaLearn instance or REAPER project
- Improved "Track mute" target by making it work reliably also on master track and by making feedback from automation work
- Improved usability by disabling learning of "Track selection" target if REAPER preference "Mouse click on volume/pan faders and track buttons changes track selection" enabled (in order to avoid false positives, preference change respected after REAPER restart)
- Improved usability by making "Master tempo" target uneligible as "Last touched" target and for learning in general (there were too many false positives and it could get annoying at times, just select the target manually in the dropdown to use it)
- Improved usability by letting the user confirm before globally removing an OSC device
- Improved usability by not firing immediately when changing the encoder turning direction while using a negative "Speed" setting (that was annoying and could result in sudden unwanted parameter changes)
- Improved usability by not annoying user with error messages when controlling just because they use some setting that doesn't make sense (such as controlling relative targets with absolute messages)
- Improved usability by clearing feedback of the previous source if a mapping source is changed
- Fixed non-working automation writing for "Track width" target when controlled via relative encoder
- Fixed often missing initial feedback for virtual controller mappings (LEDs were sometimes not updated before interacting with the project, e.g. by pressing play)
- Fixed possible "assertion failed: 0.0 &lt;= normalized_value || normalized_value.is_nan()" error with volume targets
- Fixed recent bug that caused "Track selection" target to be learned with wrong track (the previously selected one instead of the newly selected)
- Fixed recent bug that caused wrong "Selected track" target feedback

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added a bunch of controller presets
- Added possibility to refer to a track via its name or position (as an alternative to the default of using its unique and stable ID) ← That's called track anchors, a powerful addition, if you ask me!
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Added possibility to let unmatched FX input MIDI events through even when using hardware input (the checkbox isn't greyed out anymore)
- Added support for main presets (analogously to controller presets)
- Added batch-learning of multiple mappings (new button "Learn many")
- Added FX anchors (analogously to track anchors)
- Added new target FX option "&lt;Focused>" (analogously to track "&lt;Selected>")
- Added preset auto-loading depending on focused FX (!)
- Added possibility to assign mappings to different groups and set activation condition and control/feedback enable state for each group
- Added limited MIDI feedback support for MIDI CC actions (requires REAPER >= 6.20)
- Added possibility again to enter values > 100x in Speed text field (useful e.g. when using relative encoders with some NI plug-ins that report continuous parameters with step sizes that are very low)
- Added performance measuring of ReaLearn control surface methods (including exposing metrics in Prometheus format)
- Added possibility to use preset "Reset to factory default" to clear all settings, groups and mappings (without changing the session ID)
- Added user guide sections "Tested controllers" and "Tutorials"
- Added experimental new option 'Make absolute' in order to convert relative to absolute values (lets you use EEL control transformation with encoders)
- Added powerful REAPER actions for learning and finding mappings without opening ReaLearn
- Improved source character guessing (yields best results when turning clockwise!)
- Improved learning of transport buttons (now prefers ReaLearn's built-in transport target over the corresponding REAPER actions)
- Improved usability by automatically clearing filters and search expression when adding a mapping (to make sure it's shown)
- Improved preset usability by asking user whether to automatically convert project-anchored targets to project-independent ones
- Improved usability by scrolling to newly added/duplicated mapping if necessary
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Improved usability by making most confirmation and alert dialogs modal with respect to the ReaLearn window itself, not REAPER
- Improved accessibility by fixing tab order, default buttons and initial focus (affects mapping panel only because REAPER doesn't seem to support tab control in the actual main FX window)
- Improved consistency by letting program numbers start at 0 (just a visual change)
- Improved versatility by increasing number of conditional-activation parameters to 100
- Improved quality assurance by adding a few integration tests (new developer action)
- Improved usability by making online and offline user guide accessible via context menu (plus some other links)
- Improved usability by also stopping source filter learning when clearing the source filter
- Improved usability disabling all control while learning a target (no more undesired target learning by moving an already assigned control, at least within one ReaLearn instance)
- Improved usability by including source character in mapping row source label (makes it easier to spot character guessing issues)
- Improved (N)RPN scanning to support popular controllers (such as Behringer BCR2000), prefer value-MSB-first now
- Improved user interface by making mapping rows less grey and adding some horizontal rules
- Improved usability by making "Absolute" the default invocation mode for actions, was "Trigger" before (this change could break some action mappings done with previous 1.12.0 prereleases)
- Improved "Length" sliders to work for "Incremental buttons" mode, too
- Improved usability by always sorting groups alphabetically
- Improved usage of ReaLearn as monitoring FX by making parameter feedback and learning work (usually, REAPER extensions don't get notified of anything happening on the monitoring FX chain, but at least for ReaLearn parameter changes I managed to create a workaround ... which is good news especially for global conditional activation use cases)
- Improved user guide (related to keyboard input, monitoring FX and limitations of monitoring FX)
- Improved safety by warning whenever loading something made in a newer ReaLearn version than the current one (version number gets part of the preset data, that also paves the way for preset migration)
- Improved usability by preferring position anchors over ID anchors when learning from a ReaLearn instance that is on the monitoring FX chain
- Improved wording related to encoders, renamed internal named parameter for setting state to 'set-state'
- Improved usability by making ID now really the new default FX anchor, not 'ID or position'
- Improved awareness by changing the prime EEL control transformation example into an actually very useful one: a curve
- Improved usability by indicating if MIDI input or output device disabled in REAPER preferences
- Improved behavior by disabling control (not just feedback) for disabled ReaLearn FX instances (before this, it still kept controlling when a device was selected as 'MIDI control input')
- Improved projection QR code detection rate by greatly simplifying it for now (doesn't carry certificate content anymore, which was only useful when using web-based companion app from mobile device, which is an edge case, especially considering that an iOS app is on the way)
- Improved usability by automatically switch off source/target filter learning when doing certain UI interactions
- Fixed nonsense learning of virtual sources in controller mappings compartment (that was really bad for batch learning control elements)
- Fixed missing mapping lanel UI update when learning other parameter of same FX
- Fixed 'Solo' target learning (was always resulting in master track)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn-monitoring-FX controlled targets to become sticky when switching between project tabs (not updating correctly)
- Fixed error message when pressing space bar in an empty ReaLearn instance
- Fixed possible "Raw pointer..." error when using track selection targets
- Fixed possible "couldn't get FX param value..." error when using FX parameter target
- Fixed action invocation mode "trigger", which sometimes wouldn't fire
- Fixed misleading labels in mapping panel
- Fixed feedback when reverse enabled and target range non-symmetric
- Fixed bug with broken plug-ins that report parameter as discrete but with a nonsensical step size of zero
- Fixed broken arrow symbols on Windows 7 (display rectangles instead of arrows)
- Fixed "Couldn't get preset count" error
- Fixed (N)RPN learning and consumption check
- Fixed wrong info that feedback not working for (N)RPN (it works!)
- Fixed "Track send pan" target (was confused with "Track send volume")
- Fixed bug that caused overscrolling when clicking on "Find in mapping list" button
- Fixed inconsistent feedback processing order (changes behavior of existing feedback transformation formulas if used in combination with source or target interval restrictions, so they might need some adjustment!)
- Fixed error when choosing non-MSB controller for 14-bit CC sources (now silently converted to MSB controller)
- Fixed "Find in mapping list" not switching mapping compartment
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action
- Fixed "is not a valid unit value" error (happened when reading volume values above the fader limit set in REAPER preferences)
- Fixed "negative MIDI frame offset" error (negative offsets are interpreted as zero now)
- Fixed "Message: assertion failed: Bpm::is_valid(value)" error (could happen when using controllers that send MIDI clock)
- Fixed "Message: -1 is not a valid value" error (caused by unexpected FX parameter change value)
- Fixed Windows 7 character issues in dropdown menus
- Fixed error message if track could not be found
- Fixed REAPER crash when using automation on ReaLearn conditional-activation parameters
- Fixed error when encountering MIDI device name with incorrectly encoded special characters
- Fixed error when encountering invalid MIDI messages (they are now ignored)
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn to stop working when project paused and ReaLearn track not armed
- Fixed auto correction for "Send feedback only if track armed"
- Fixed bug that could cause target value to get stuck if step size too small when it could be avoided
- Fixed "BorrowMut" error and potential race conditions when "Allow live FX multiprocessing" enabled
- Fixed segmentation fault on Linux when loading ReaLearn after plug-in scan
- Fixed wrong reverse behavior in 'Normal' mode when target value range is non-symmetric (old presets will keep their wrong behavior in order to not break existing projects)

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added controller mapping feature (possibility to define controller-specific mappings, virtual sources and virtual targets)
- Added controller projection feature (by using the new ReaLearn Companion app)
- Added indication of scroll position and number of mappings
- Improved usability by rethinking the mapping mode concept (The mapping window section is now called "Tuning" instead of "Mode" because a mapping can now cope with both relative and absolute source values, no matter the mode! It just depends on whatever value type the source emits - relative or absolute values. From now on, the "Mode" just describes how to interpret incoming absolute values. This is a "mostly" backward-compatible change since it changes only behavior of mappings that didn't have an effect anyway till now because source value type and mode didn't match.)
- Improved usability by indicating mappings that are "off" by greying them out
- Improved resource usage by greatly reducing project file size, undo entry size and preset size
- Improve error logging (makes it easier to map debug symbols, on Windows at least)
- Fixed bug that caused initial parameter values to be sometimes ignored in conditional activation
- Fixed scrolling issues when mapping list filtered
- Fixed error message when trying to pick action

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added feature 'conditional activation' for (de)activating mappings based on parameter values
- Added transport target with proper feedback (play/pause, play/stop, record, repeat)
- Added option to send feedback after each control cycle
- Added possibility to further specify "Out of range" behavior (the new option "Min" is especially useful for mappings where a button sets a target to a specific constant value)
- Improved installation instructions and added controller tips to the documentation
- Improved usability by showing hierarchical folder structure in track dropdown
- Improved usability by asking user for confirmation before removing a mapping
- Improved usability by simplifying mapping window title
- Fixed strange and unreliable feedback if target min is equal to target max
- Fixed bug that caused "FX must have focus" to not work at all with floating windows and work incorrectly when in FX chain
- Fixed action targets reporting wrong character, leading to wrong auto correction behavior

                <changelog><![CDATA[- Added Linux support
- Added target 'Selected track' for navigating within track list
- Added mapping name search
- Added support for non-latin characters (in mapping names and when showing track names)
- Added support for using ReaLearn as monitoring FX
- Added version and build information to UI
- Added possibility to quickly check what a certain knob/fader/encoder/switch actually controls, without actually changing target parameters (implemented by simply making source filter run until pressing 'Stop' and by not filtering unknown sources)
- Added feedback for target 'Track FX preset'
- Added possibility for relative mode to throttle/slow-down relative increments (the 'step count' sliders are now called 'speed', negative values represent throttling)
- Added possibility for absolute and toggle modes to distinguish between short/long button presses ('Length' slider allows you to define press durations on millisecond granularity - obviously works with momentary switches only)
- Added mapping option 'Prevent echo feedback' (good for motorized faders that don't like feedback while being moved)
- Added target 'Track FX all enable' (without feedback)
- Added feedback transformation for relative and toggle mode, too (because feedback is always absolute)
- Added possibility to access current target value in control transformation (initial value of y)
- Added feedback reset logic when source not in use anymore (e.g. sends 'zero' feedback value if mapping removed)
- Added developer action for resolving backtraces that just contain addresses (also stripped debug symbols from Linux release artifact)
- Added option to send MIDI feedback to 'FX output' instead of directly to MIDI hardware device
- Added button 'Log debug info' for printing some debug information on a terminal (not the REAPER console!)
- Improved error handling: Some possible smaller errors/misbehaviors where totally ignored in previous versions and therefore might have gone unnoticed. In this version, ReaLearn will print a bug report if it detects such a smaller error, exactly like it already did before with more serious errors. (ReaLearn follows a fail-fast approach in order to detect errors early instead of letting them introduce subtle and hard-to-analyze bugs.)
- Improved toggle mode by letting Source Min/Max clamp feedback value just like in other modes
- Improved 'Log debug info' by logging to REAPER console instead of terminal
- Improved behavior when using 'Learn source filter': Also indicate if a source has been touched that is not used in any mapping (by showing an empty mapping list)
- Improved UI for action target (now uses REAPER's built-in action picker)
- Improved duplicate naming ('Copy of ...')
- Improved UI by immediately reflecting track name changes
- Improved UI by using actual arrow symbols (macOS and Windows only)
- Improved UI by having better error window if clipboard import is wrong
- Improved UI by instantly updating mapping name and all other values changed via text input field while typing
- Improved feedback by keeping it more in sync with the mapping settings (e.g. also updates while changing target range)
- Improved relative mode by giving the 'step size' / 'step count' (now 'speed') controls an overhaul
- Improved usability by not letting target fields forget their values when switching type
- Included more diagnostic information in error log messages (debug info such as line numbers)
- Made a complete rewrite in Rust programming language
- Published as open source (available on GitHub)
- Fixed logic error after learning target on master track
- Fixed crashes on logic errors while executing VST plug-in callbacks. Now it just reports an error message instead of aborting REAPER.
- Fixed non-working 'Track must be selected' target condition
- Fixed non-moving slider when slider currently focused
- Fixed some FX parameter target bugs which caused ReaLearn to error on particular values
- Fixed another possible 'ghost session' bug (ReaLearn sticking around although already unloaded)
- Fixed non-working FX parameter selection
- Fixed sometimes not working FX parameter learn
- Fixed possible missing learn/feedback notification right after startup
- Fixed possible error message when using -inf dB
- Fixed bug that caused ReaLearn instance to stay around as a ghost even if already removed. That caused surprising issues e.g. complaints about a target parameter not being found which was not used at all.
- Fixed continuous MIDI feedback of automated FX parameter values, track send volume and track send pan. Now fires on real value changes only. It’s still possible that ReaLearn sends more feedback than necessary when having automation. This can happen if there are value changes but they are so small that they don’t have any effect on the feedback MIDI value (because MIDI feedback values have a very low resolution).)
- Fixed some random error messages when using FX parameter target with parameters that report step sizes
- Fixed crashes when removing plug-ins
- Fixed bug that caused feedback and learn not working with master track

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 ReaLearn is a VST instrument plug-in which works in REAPER only. Its purpose is to improve REAPER\u8217's MIDI learn capabilities and add MIDI feedback (e.g.\u160?via LEDs and motorized faders). If you frequently need to map MIDI controller elements like knobs or switches to REAPER functions such as FX parameters or actions, ReaLearn might be useful for you.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 REAPER itself has this capability but some useful MIDI control scenarios are quite difficult and time-consuming to achieve with REAPER alone, for example if you want to restrict the controlled target value range. You would need to tinker with things like MIDIToReaControlPath and general purpose MIDI plug-ins. ReaLearn tries to make that much easier by giving you instant and easy access to lots of advanced features out-of-the-box.\par}
